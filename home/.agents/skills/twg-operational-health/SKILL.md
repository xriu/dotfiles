# twg-operational-health

Use together with the root `twg` skill. Exact command grammar comes from live
`twg help` or `twg help describe <path>`.

## CLI launcher fallback

Run `twg <command>`. On shell `command not found`, use `$HOME/.local/bin/twg`
(macOS/Linux) / `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\twg\bin\twg.exe` (PowerShell), then
tell user to add that directory to PATH. Do not treat auth or command errors as
PATH failures.

## Use When

- "I'm taking over on-call"
- "Reliability, incident, SEV, or post-incident review readout"
- "Investigate an active incident and find mitigation"
- "Analyze root cause or draft postmortem/PIR learning/action items"
- "Open risks, blockers, overloaded people, operational health"

## First Move

Resolve scope, window, anchors, owner/escalation, status, recency, and
follow-ups before joining surfaces. For incident, PIR, reliability, or on-call
requests, start with native JSM incident, post-incident-review, or Jira
workitem records when available. Use Rovo or document search only to
disambiguate an anchor or fill a bounded gap, never as the incident inventory.
Current escalation, owner, and readiness claims need current/open evidence;
closed records provide recurrence context, not present-state proof.
Run without `--site`; TWG inherits the user's pinned Jira/JSM site. Only add a
site override when the user explicitly requests another tenant. Never assume a
vendor-internal incident site.

## Evidence Policy

- Rank by impact, urgency, owner clarity, recurrence risk, and actionability;
  separate live risks from historical mentions.
- Keep operational state distinct from adjacent PR, pipeline, document, or chat
  activity; missing or inaccessible state is an evidence gap.
- Cluster incident, PIR, follow-up, runbook, owner, asset, or meeting evidence
  by service, theme, owner, and recency. Hydrate highest-risk clusters and
  stop when theme, owner signal, and confidence are clear.
- Separate `working theory`, `confirmed problem`, `mitigation`, and `root
  cause`; require a causal mechanism for root cause and label claims
  `confirmed`, `supported`, `candidate`, or `missing evidence`.
- After one repeated backend, auth, or schema error, report the gap and use
  remaining evidence instead of aliases or broad inventories.
- Read build health from `bitbucket pipeline query`, not per-pipeline `get`;
  raise its default `--limit 15` when needed, state the covered span, and
  hydrate ranked sets through one batched `get`.

## Recipe Cards

### Leadership Reliability Review / On-Call Handoff

Load `references/reliability-review.md`. Resolve leader, platform, and window;
cluster themes, separate cause from mitigation, connect prevention work, and
rank actions. For handoffs, add a first-hour checklist and escalation map.

### Incident Investigation / Mitigation

Use for active, newly mitigated, or pre-PIR incidents. Anchor on the incident,
then gather responders, symptoms, impact, recent deploys/flags/config,
topology, alert/log/metric pointers, ownership, runbooks, and similar cases.
If fields are sparse, probe four golden-signal families with bounded follow-ups.
See `references/incident-investigation.md`. Output a four-signal matrix,
hypotheses, confidence, next checks, and mitigation options; never call
mitigation the root cause without its mechanism.

### Post-Incident Root Cause / Learning

Use after mitigation/recovery when drafting or evaluating a PIR. Pair the
incident with the PIR, linked docs, final comms, remediation PRs, and actions;
cover mitigation, causal mechanism, 5-whys, and detection/response gaps. See
`references/pir-root-cause.md`. Output root cause, contributing factors,
mitigation-versus-cause, and prioritized actions.

### Assets / Asset Refresh

Build contributors from project/goal/Jira/PR/doc/activity evidence. Inspect
Assets schema/type metadata before AQL; join people through discovered user-like
attributes such as `Calculated user`. Rank contribution centrality plus asset
risk and report confidence/gaps. See `references/assets.md`.

### Capacity / Staffing / Meetings

For staffing, resolve project/topic/org and identify people by related work,
ownership, review influence, docs, and project/goal involvement; check load
before recommending. For meetings, query scoped recordings, preview transcripts,
fetch full transcripts only for central ones, then summarize decisions, actions,
and gaps.

## Output Shape

- Lead with severity, urgency, or recommendation, then owner, status, recency,
  impact, confidence, and evidence.
- For active investigations, add a four-signal matrix and an incident-to-
  learning timeline covering problem, mitigation, root-cause status, and
  prevention.
- Group artifact patterns, rank next actions with a suggested owner, and call
  out gaps such as missing transcripts, ACL/auth failures, stale updates, or
  weak ownership.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not fetch every transcript/page body or treat every incident mention as a
  live risk.
- Do not wait for chat/comments to surface directional pre-PIR hypotheses.
- Do not call mitigation root cause without a mechanism or treat workflow
  panels, bot comments, or opaque fields as RCA narrative.
- Do not use keyword matches alone as ownership; cross-check assignee, service
  owner, PIR participants, or org-tree membership.
- Do not join Assets by display-name guesses or recommend staffing from
  activity counts alone.
