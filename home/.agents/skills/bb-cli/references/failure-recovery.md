# Failure and interruption recovery

## Failures And Interruptions

- For failed threads, inspect `bb thread show <id> --json` and
  `bb thread log <id>` before deciding whether to retry, clarify, or update the
  user.
- Use `bb thread retry <thread-id>` to re-send a failed turn's original message
  verbatim. It re-submits the same input — it does not add a new user message to
  the timeline — and increments the attempt number (2 is the first retry). With
  no `--turn` it retries the most recent turn, the one whose failure put the
  thread in `error`; `--turn <requestId>` asserts which turn you mean and fails
  when the thread has moved on. It errors when the thread has not failed or
  `--turn` names a different turn (409 `no_failed_turn`), and when that turn
  already has a retry queued (`retry_already_queued`). Add `--send-at <when>` to
  queue the retry on the clock (same `<when>` grammar as `bb thread tell
--send-at`); without it the retry is attempted now and may still queue behind
  a busy thread or a plugin's dispatch hook. `--reason <text>` labels the queued
  row. The SDK equivalent is `sdk.threads.retry({ threadId, turnRequestId?,
sendAt?, reason? })`.
- For interrupted or stopped threads, inspect first. If the user stopped the
  thread, treat that as intentional unless they ask you to continue.
- Use `bb thread stop <id>` when a thread is stuck or no longer needed.
- `bb thread stop <id>` also releases an idle or stuck agent runtime. The
  command is idempotent and preserves thread history. An explicit stop also
  interrupts a turn the machine retains while the server sees idle or failed,
  including a turn that starts during the stop. If interruption fails, the
  thread remains stopping; inspect its status before treating Stop as confirmed.
- Use `bb thread compact <id>` to send the built-in `/compact` command to an idle or errored thread. Completion or failure appears in the timeline. Provider support varies; consult its skill and reported capabilities.
- Use `bb thread clear <id>` on an idle or failed thread to reset its active
  timeline and model context in place while keeping the same BB thread,
  workspace, durable event history, and sticky execution settings.
- A send that fails with `provider_session_unavailable` means the thread's
  recorded provider session belongs to another thread (`details.reason:
"foreign"`) or was announced by another thread in the same millisecond
  (`"ambiguous"`), or its identity handle is missing or empty (`"invalid"`).
  bb refuses to resume it or silently replace its context rather than write into another
  conversation. `bb thread clear <id>` starts a new provider session on the
  next send and keeps the thread's history.
- Message edits refuse to erase an ownership claim also recorded by another
  thread when doing so could transfer or resolve that shared claim. This check
  runs before preparing the edit and again before rewriting history. Use
  `bb thread clear <id>` to start fresh while retaining the ownership evidence.
  Ownership still depends on retained records; purging all records of the
  original owner removes that protection.
- Use `bb thread cancel-plan <id>` to exit an active Plan turn without
  optimistically clearing its banner. Use `bb thread clear-goal <id>` to clear
  a thread's durable active Goal when supported by its provider. Both wait for provider confirmation.
