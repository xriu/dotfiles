# bb app settings reference

Server-backed preferences in Settings. They are persisted on the server, so
every window and client sees the same value.

## Setting values

- `bb settings general <key> <value>` accepts any key listed under
  `generalSettings` in `bb settings show`. Boolean preferences take `true`,
  `false`, `on`, or `off`; `null` clears a preference that can be unset.
- Unknown keys and values of the wrong shape are rejected; the error names the
  keys bb knows.

## Setup guide

- A new bb install opens a first-run setup guide: connect an agent, add
  projects, pick plugins, and set up devices. Every step can be skipped.
- `onboardingCompletedAt` is the ISO timestamp of when the guide was finished
  or skipped; `null` means the guide is showing.
- `bb settings replay-onboarding` clears it. Settings → General → Setup guide
  has the same button.
- `bb project discover [--machine <id-or-name>]` lists the git repositories the
  guide offers to import; add one with `bb project create --name <name> --root <path>`.

## Sidebar preferences

The sidebar thread list defaults to `__automatic__`: the first installed thread list
plugin other than the bundled Thread list plugin (`thread-list/thread-list`), or the
bundled plugin when there is none. Installing a thread list plugin therefore switches
to it. Legacy `__builtin__` selections resolve to the bundled plugin; other plugin
selections are preserved.
Use `bb settings ui reset sidebar.threadListProvider` to restore Automatic, or
`bb settings ui set sidebar.threadListProvider <plugin-id>/<slot-id>` to select
another plugin. The SDK exposes the same setting through `uiPreferences`.

`sidebar.pluginPanelOrder` and `sidebar.visiblePluginPanels` order and show or
hide the navigation rail's destinations (see Navigation rail below).

- The server keeps a keyed, revisioned registry of sidebar layout preferences
  (`sidebar.organizationMode`, `sidebar.threadGrouping.environment`,
  `sidebar.chronologicalSort`, the section
  orders, the collapsed-id lists, `sidebar.hiddenGroups`,
  `sidebar.pluginPanelOrder`, `sidebar.visiblePluginPanels`,
  `sidebar.threadListProvider`).
- The same registry stores `infoPanel.collapsedSections`, the thread Info panel
  sections collapsed from their headings (`commits`, `uncommittedChanges`,
  `forks`, `threadStorage`). Read or change it with `bb settings ui get` and
  `bb settings ui set`.
- The built-in sidebar's Filter selects Active and Archived, defaulting to Active,
  including threads with saved messages. This selection is browser-local, not
  a server-backed preference or SDK/CLI setting. Selected archived rows
  retain their hierarchy placement and offer a restore action. Archived pages load only while selected;
  plugin sidebar replacements keep ownership of their rendering.
- The palette's Filter selects Active and Archived independently of the
  sidebar, defaulting to Active. This selection is browser-local, not configurable
  through SDK/CLI. Active includes threads with saved messages; Search threads
  retains existing title and conversation matching. Archived recents load only while selected and are
  bounded at the server.
- `sidebar.organizationMode` defaults to Custom (`chronological`) on new installs.
  Migrated installs with existing projects, threads, or UI preferences fall back to
  By project (`project`). Saved server choices win over legacy browser choices,
  which win over the installation fallback. Reset saves that fallback explicitly.
- `sidebar.threadGrouping.environment` decides whether sibling threads sharing
  one worktree environment collapse into a single worktree row inside their
  section: `true` groups them and `false` keeps every thread on its own row, in
  every organization mode. The default `auto` groups them in By project and By
  machine and leaves them flat in Custom. Set it through Organize → Groups →
  By environment, settings, or the CLI. Each `sidebar.threadGrouping.*` key
  toggles one grouping dimension independently.
- `bb settings ui list [--json]` prints every key with its value, revision,
  and description; `bb settings ui get <key> [--json]` prints one.
- `bb settings ui set <key> <value> [--json]` takes a plain string for enum
  and provider keys and JSON for lists or `null`; it reads the current
  revision, writes with it, and retries once on a conflict.
- `bb settings ui reset <key> [--json]` writes the default and advances the
  revision.

### Thread-list visibility

- The bundled Thread list plugin owns its layout preferences, including hidden
  groups. Use `bb thread-list prefs list [--json]` to inspect them and
  `bb thread-list prefs get/set/reset <key>` to change them.
- Its installed `thread-list` skill documents accepted keys and values. Keep
  plugin-specific settings out of `bb settings ui`; those legacy values are
  read only during one-time migration.

## Git controls

- Settings → General → Show Git changes and Commit button defaults to on.
- `bb settings general showGitChanges false` hides the untracked, uncommitted,
  and committed summary and file list, pull-request status and actions above the
  composer, and Commit in the header and overflow menu.
- Set it to `true` to restore them across every thread and connected client.
  The server saves the choice across reloads.
- Thread relationships and workspace warnings remain visible.
- SDK callers use `sdk.system.updateGeneralSettings` with the current settings
  and `showGitChanges`. Older clients that omit it preserve the saved choice.

## Cleared context history

- Settings → General → Show messages from before a context clear defaults to off.
- `bb settings general keepHistoryAfterContextClear true` keeps messages from
  before the latest `Context cleared` boundary in the timeline, conversation
  outline, and `bb thread log --message` lookups. The next prompt still starts a
  fresh provider conversation, and the context meter still resets.
- SDK callers use `sdk.system.updateGeneralSettings` with the current settings
  and `keepHistoryAfterContextClear`. Older clients that omit it preserve the
  saved choice.

## Keyboard shortcuts

- `showKeyboardHints` defaults to true. Set it with
  `bb settings keyboard hints <true|false|on|off>` to control whether
  delayed shortcut badges appear while holding Command or Control. It does not
  disable the shortcuts themselves.
- Settings → Keyboard records sparse per-command chord overrides. `Mod` means
  Command on macOS and Control on Windows/Linux.
- Reset removes the override and follows bb's current default. Clear stores an
  explicit disabled value.
- Bindings for non-native actions apply in browser and desktop clients. Command
  contexts and native-only availability remain server-owned. Reusing a chord
  can be intentional when contexts do not overlap; the UI identifies reuse.
- New Thread, New Window, New Tab, Close, and Settings in the desktop menu use
  the same resolved shortcuts as renderer commands.
- The complete default table is in `docs/configuration.md` in the bb source
  repository.

## Diagnostic events

- `showDiagnosticEvents` defaults to false in all builds. Set it with
  `bb settings general showDiagnosticEvents <true|false|on|off>`.
- Enables provider environment resolution and unhandled provider events in the
  timeline. Warnings, errors, and model fallback stay visible regardless.
- Existing unhandled-provider-events preferences carry over to this setting.

## Active-thread Enter behavior

- `steerActiveThreadOnEnter` defaults to true for a new install. An earlier
  install with saved settings or work keeps false. Set it with
  `bb settings general steerActiveThreadOnEnter <true|false|on|off>`.
- Outside an open composer typeahead menu, disabling it makes Enter queue a
  follow-up and Command+Enter steer the active turn. When enabled, those
  actions are reversed.
- Shift+Enter inserts a newline. On coarse-pointer touch devices, the
  software-keyboard Return path stays a newline; iPadOS WebKit preserves the
  Enter shortcuts for a connected Magic Keyboard.

## Archive confirmation

- `confirmThreadArchive` defaults to true. Set it with
  `bb settings general confirmThreadArchive <true|false|on|off>`.
- Turn it off to archive a parent and child threads without the confirmation
  popup. Undo remains available in the archive toast. This server-wide setting
  applies to all connected app clients. CLI and SDK archive calls remain
  non-interactive.

## Streamer mode

- `streamerMode` defaults to false. Set it with
  `bb settings general streamerMode <true|false|on|off>`.
- When enabled, every `customModels` entry from `~/.bb/config.json` is hidden
  in all model lists: the pickers, `bb provider models`, and
  `sdk.providers.models`. Use it during a screen share so a private or
  early-access model id does not appear.
- The entries stay in `config.json`. A thread request that names a hidden model
  explicitly still runs with it, and default model resolution for a new thread
  keeps the full list.
- A composer whose stored selection is a hidden model falls back to the
  provider default, and the next send records that default. Select the custom
  model again after you turn streamer mode off.

## Fast service tier

- `allowFastServiceTier` defaults to true. Set it with
  `bb settings general allowFastServiceTier <true|false|on|off>` or use the
  switch in Settings → Providers.
- When disabled, new turns use the default tier even if a request, project
  default, automation, or queued message selected another tier (`fast`, Codex
  `ultrafast`, or any other tier a provider lists). The app hides the service
  tier control.
  Turn it on to choose fast again; project defaults saved while it was off
  retain the default tier.

## New branch prefix

- `managedBranchPrefix` defaults to `bb/`. Set it with
  `bb settings general managedBranchPrefix <prefix>`.
- bb puts the prefix in front of every branch name it creates for a managed
  worktree or a new checkout branch, so the default gives
  `bb/fix-login-flow-thr_ab12cd34ef`.
- A prefix does not need a trailing slash. `sawyer/wt-` gives
  `sawyer/wt-fix-login-flow-thr_ab12cd34ef`, and an empty prefix gives
  `fix-login-flow-thr_ab12cd34ef`.
- bb rejects a prefix that cannot start a valid git branch name, such as one
  with a space or a leading `-`. The maximum length is 64 characters.
- The new prefix applies to branches bb creates after the change. It does not
  rename an existing branch or worktree.

## Provider order and default

- `providerOrder` defaults to `[]`. Set it to a JSON array of provider IDs.
- `defaultProviderId` defaults to `null`. Set a provider ID or use `null` to
  clear it.

## Finished turns

- When a turn finishes, bb can collapse its work into one `Worked for` row
  and leave the final answer visible (`collapse`), or keep every step visible
  (`flat`). Each provider declares a default: Claude Code is `flat`; every
  other first-party provider is `collapse`.
- `bb settings completed-turns [--json]` lists every provider with its current
  display and whether it comes from your setting or the provider default.
- `bb settings completed-turns <provider-id> <collapse|flat|default>` sets the
  display for one provider; `default` removes your setting so the provider
  default applies again. Settings → Providers has the same switch per
  provider.
- The overrides are stored in `providerCompletedTurnDisplay`, a map of provider
  ID to `collapse` or `flat`. The setting applies to every thread of that
  provider, including finished turns in existing threads, the conversation
  outline, and `bb thread log`.

## Message edits

- Eligible accepted root user messages can be edited without enabling an
  experiment. Use `bb thread edit-message` or the message editor in the app.

## Provider session release

- BB releases restorable provider sessions after 30 idle minutes.
- Active turns, commands, agents, workflows, and monitors keep sessions loaded.

## Mobile app

- Downloads are available in Settings → Mobile without opting in.
- Pair your phone under Settings → Mobile → **Add mobile device**.

## Changelog preview

- The `changelogPreview` experiment defaults to false.
- Enable it with `bb settings experiment changelogPreview true` to show the
  latest release notes on Settings → Updates.

## Navigation rail

- A vertical rail of destinations sits on the left edge of the sidebar on
  every screen size. Home is at the top and returns to the last thread; the
  visible destinations (Plugins, Skills, and plugin panels) follow; More holds
  hidden destinations and Customize rail; Settings is at the bottom.
- New thread sits in the sidebar header. The list beside the rail swaps
  between the thread list, Plugins, Skills, and Settings.
- Collapsing the sidebar hides the list beside the rail and leaves the rail in
  place.
- `sidebar.pluginPanelOrder` and `sidebar.visiblePluginPanels` order and show
  or hide rail destinations.
- In the macOS desktop app, wide windows add a title bar that holds the window
  controls, Back and Forward, and the sidebar toggle. It shares the rail's
  background, and the sidebar and page sit in a card below it.
- On narrow windows and phones the rail sits inside the drawer. Home, Plugins,
  Skills, and Settings swap the list beside it and leave the drawer open; a
  plugin page closes it.

## Timeline windowing

- Long timelines keep stable row wrappers while mounting only rows near the
  active main or nested detail scrollport.
- iPhone and iPad browsers, including the iOS app, keep every loaded row
  mounted instead. Safari there cannot correct the scroll position during a
  touch scroll's momentum, so rows measured above the viewport would move
  the text being read.

## Server move

- The `serverMove` experiment defaults to false.
- Enable it with `bb settings experiment serverMove true`.
- It shows Move server here in Settings → Machines and lets the server run
  `bb server move`, `bb server export`, and old server copy deletion.

Machine access: `bb settings general machineServerUrl https://bb.example.com`
sets the server URL reachable by machines. Set `null` to use BB_EXTERNAL_URL.
`bb settings general defaultMachineAccess direct` selects direct access;
`connect` selects bb Cloud; `null` selects the first registered access provider,
or direct when none is registered. An unpaired provider remains selected and
reports setup required. `bb settings show --json` includes serverAccess with the
effective direct URL, its source and provider availability. Availability is refreshed
on each read, with failed or timed-out checks reported as unavailable. It does
not acquire a machine grant. These grants carry runtime
requests, including account-pool traffic, after enrolment.

Automatic machine GitHub credentials are enabled by default. Use
`bb settings general machineGitCredentialsEnabled false` to stop forwarding the
server gh credentials to machines; `true` enables them again. In Machines →
Advanced settings, the automatic GH_TOKEN switch controls the same setting.
This does not log the server out or suppress an explicit custom GH_TOKEN.
Changes apply to new turns, setup commands and terminals.

Sidebar footer actions use `sidebar.footerOrder` and `sidebar.hiddenFooterItems`.
Both are string lists shared across clients. Keys are `builtin:mobile`,
`builtin:report-bug`, or `plugin:<encoded pluginId>/<encoded registrationId>`.
The footer shows as many icons as fit the sidebar's width. More is always
available and holds hidden actions plus actions that don't fit; apart from
Customize's minus, width overflow never changes saved visibility. More →
Customize footer replaces the footer row with Footer and More menu zones: minus
removes an icon and keeps current overflow hidden so its slot stays empty, plus
adds a More item while the footer has room, and drag reorders within a zone. More → Hide footer
hides every action, and Show footer shows them again.
Right-click an action for Hide from footer or Customize footer.
Settings → Appearance → Sidebar footer edits the same preferences. CLI example:
`bb settings ui set sidebar.hiddenFooterItems '["plugin:bb--provider-usage/usage"]'`.
Use `bb settings ui reset sidebar.hiddenFooterItems` to restore the default footer.

Disable anonymous usage telemetry with `bb settings general telemetryEnabled false`
or Settings → General → Privacy & diagnostics → Share anonymous usage data. This server-wide preference
applies immediately and persists across restarts. `BB_TELEMETRY=false` overrides it.

Mobile app downloads are always available in Settings → Mobile (`/settings/mobile`).
**Join iOS TestFlight** opens https://testflight.apple.com/join/T9MayTMb.
**Download Android APK** downloads directly from the public `get-bb/bb` GitHub
`android-testing` release's `bb-android.apk` asset. The APK does not pass through
the bb server or its remote-access tunnel. No experiment or Android developer tools are needed.
Pair either app through Settings → Mobile → **Add mobile device**.

Use `bb settings mobile-app --json` or SDK `system.mobileAppDownloads()` to get
both public links. Add `--details --json` or call `system.mobileAppReleases()`
(GET `/api/v1/system/mobile-app-releases`) for Android version/build, size, and
upload date. The server fetches only public metadata, caches it for five minutes,
and returns `android: null` if unavailable or inconsistent. Download links remain
usable during metadata failures. iOS version and release date are shown in TestFlight.
Inside the Android app, this page compares the installed native build number
with the published APK and shows whether an update is available. Older apps
without build-number reporting cannot determine update status. Installed version
and build are device-local; CLI and SDK release metadata report the published APK.
Publish updates with **Mobile Android (EAS)**, profile `preview`, **publish** on.

Right-clicking the composer microphone, pressing Shift+F10, or clicking the
Microphone control in Settings → Voice Input opens client-local voice preferences: a desktop popover or mobile drawer. Opening it
starts a local waveform preview; select an input directly from the list. Closing
the picker stops the preview. The recording row has no microphone menu.
Missing or unreadable inputs fall back automatically; a missing preference alone
is informational. Sustained silence warns without switching devices or stopping
capture. Device selection remains browser-local; server voice-service settings
and file transcription commands are unchanged.
