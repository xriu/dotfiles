# bb CLI

Use `bb` when controlling bb itself: inspect current context, coordinate threads,
message agents, or inspect projects, providers, and environments.

## Start With Context

- Use `bb status` to identify the current project, thread, and environment.
  It also lists enabled plugins that are not running (incompatible, error,
  missing); `bb plugin list` shows each plugin's status detail.
- Prefer `--json` when command output will drive follow-up work.
- Run `bb guide` for the system overview and `bb guide <chapter>` for full
  command reference.
- A standalone `bb` CLI with no connection env targets the default local server
  at `http://127.0.0.1:38886` and host daemon port `38887`. Set
  `BB_SERVER_URL` and `BB_HOST_DAEMON_PORT` only for remote or non-default
  targets. The Add machine installer injects its enrolled daemon's selected
  local API port automatically and atomically reserves it across default and
  custom machine data directories.
- The main server and source Vite app bind to loopback by default. Use bb
  connect or a private Tailscale Serve URL for remote browsers and execution
  machines. `--server-bind-host 0.0.0.0` is a compatibility escape hatch only:
  the public API is unauthenticated and permits command execution and file
  reads, so wildcard binding requires a trusted network boundary. The startup
  listener and `app` rows then show `http://0.0.0.0:<port>`; health checks and
  the colocated daemon still use loopback. This opt-in is IPv4-only. Containers
  must also publish the port to the host.

## Environment Setup Script

- To make a repo work with bb worktrees, run `bb guide environments`. It
  documents the repo-level `.bb-env-setup.sh` setup hook and the
  `.worktreeinclude` file.
- A new worktree checks out tracked files only. Commit a `.worktreeinclude`
  file at the repo root to list untracked files, such as `.env`, that bb must
  copy from the source checkout. It uses gitignore pattern syntax. bb copies
  the matches before it runs `.bb-env-setup.sh`.

## Remote Client

- `bb-app client ssh-target set <server-origin> <ssh-target> [--host-id <id>]`
  configures the
  local helper to open files from a remote bb server in local editors. The SSH
  target is the value that works after `ssh`, such as `devbox` or
  `user@devbox`. Pass the work-host ID from `bb machine list` when the server
  has more than one machine; single-machine servers are selected automatically.
- These mappings live on the client machine in `<dataDir>/client.json`;
  the CLI resolves the server's host ID when writing the mapping, and the remote
  server does not read the file.
- Use `bb-app client ssh-target list --json` to inspect mappings.

## App Settings

- `BB_INFERENCE` selects the shared model for server-side helper completions,
  including thread titles and commit subjects. It defaults to
  `codex/gpt-5.6-luna`; set an override with
  `bb-app config set BB_INFERENCE <provider/model>`.
- `BB_INFERENCE_FALLBACK` selects the helper model used after a transient
  primary timeout, rate limit, or service-unavailable failure. It defaults to
  `codex/gpt-5.4-mini`; set it with
  `bb-app config set BB_INFERENCE_FALLBACK <provider/model>`.
- `BB_TRANSCRIPTION` selects the voice transcription model. It defaults to
  `codex/gpt-transcribe`; set an override with
  `bb-app config set BB_TRANSCRIPTION <provider/model>`.
- `bb-app config` and `bb-app env` reload runtime settings in a running server,
  but the CLI identifies server and launcher settings that are startup-only,
  including binding/ports, data and the dev-app port, telemetry, inherited skill
  roots, and `BB_FF_*` flags. `BB_LOG_LEVEL` is also startup-only. Use
  `bb-app config`, not `bb-app env`, to change `BB_APP_URL`, `BB_INFERENCE`,
  `BB_INFERENCE_FALLBACK`, or `BB_TRANSCRIPTION` live. After a startup-only
  change, run `bb-app stop && bb-app start` or restart the desktop app. Until
  then, a server previously bound to `0.0.0.0` remains exposed even if
  `BB_SERVER_BIND_HOST` was changed or unset.
- Settings → General holds server-backed app-wide preferences. For details, read
  `references/app-settings.md` (in this skill's directory).
- Keep Awake is a standalone builtin plugin. Use `bb keep-awake enable` and
  `bb keep-awake disable` to configure its macOS idle-sleep assertion. Inspect
  it with `bb keep-awake status [--json]`. Target hosts with
  `bb keep-awake hosts all` or `bb keep-awake hosts <host-id>...`.
- The `showUnhandledProviderEvents` General preference defaults to false and
  exposes raw provider events that bb does not yet understand in packaged
  builds. Development builds always show those diagnostic rows. Update it with
  `bb settings general showUnhandledProviderEvents <true|false>`.
- The `steerActiveThreadOnEnter` General preference defaults to false. Outside
  an open composer typeahead menu, enable it to make Enter steer a running
  thread and Command+Enter queue a follow-up; when disabled, those actions are
  reversed. Shift+Enter inserts a newline. On coarse-pointer touch devices,
  the software keyboard keeps Return as a newline; iPadOS WebKit preserves the
  Enter shortcuts for a connected Magic Keyboard. Update the preference with
  `bb settings general steerActiveThreadOnEnter <true|false>`.
- The `streamerMode` General preference defaults to false. Enable it to hide
  every `customModels` entry from `~/.bb/config.json` in all model lists
  (pickers, `bb provider models`, and the SDK) during a screen share. Update it
  with `bb settings general streamerMode <true|false>`.
- Settings → Keyboard records server-backed per-command shortcut overrides.
  The `showKeyboardHints` preference controls the delayed badges shown while
  holding Command or Control and defaults to true; update it with
  `bb settings keyboard hints <true|false>`.
  Reset returns to bb's current default; Clear disables the command. Non-native
  actions apply in browser and desktop clients, and desktop menu accelerators
  use the same resolved bindings. For details, read
  `references/app-settings.md`.
- Use `bb settings show`, `bb settings ai-services`, `bb settings general`, `bb settings experiment`,
  `bb settings keyboard`, `bb settings usage`, and `bb settings version` to
  inspect or change these server-backed values from agents. Pass
  `bb settings usage --machine <id-or-name>` to read provider limits from a
  specific connected machine instead of the primary machine.
- Extensions provides the unified Skills and Plugins management UI, while
  Automations stays in the Plugins section beside threads.
- The default-off `changelogPreview` experiment shows the latest release notes
  on Settings → Updates. Change it with
  `bb settings experiment changelogPreview <true|false>`.
- The default-on `editMessages` experiment allows accepted root user messages
  in Codex, Claude Code, and Pi threads to be replaced and rerun, including
  failed or incomplete turns. Submitting an edit to a running thread stops and
  settles the current turn first. Change it with:
  `bb settings experiment editMessages <true|false>`.
- The default-off `timelineWindowing` experiment mounts only nearby rows in
  long timelines and large expanded timeline details. Change it with
  `bb settings experiment timelineWindowing <true|false>`.
- Thread timeline windows are capped by event count as well as by user-message
  count (`BB_FF_TIMELINE_WINDOW_EVENT_BUDGET`, default 1500), because a thread
  with few user messages but many events would otherwise reproject its whole
  history on every timeline request, blocking the server event loop and
  delaying the daemon endpoints the agent awaits between tool calls. A turn
  still running is cut at the budget as well, so a very long turn costs the
  budget per update rather than growing without limit; a finished turn is
  rendered whole. Older activity loads automatically as you scroll toward the
  top; nothing becomes unreachable.

## Agent Instructions

- Add `AGENTS.md` to the bb data dir (usually `~/.bb/AGENTS.md`) to inject
  user-level default instructions for every provider-backed thread across all
  projects.
- Add `.bb/AGENTS.md` at a workspace root to inject repo-specific instructions
  into every thread that runs there. Track the workspace file with git so fresh
  managed worktrees include it.
- bb appends data-dir instructions first, then workspace instructions, to the
  thread system prompt for all providers when a provider session starts.
- Only the plural `AGENTS.md` is read, only from those exact locations (no
  parent-directory walk); an empty file is ignored. Run
  `bb guide agent-configuration` for details (it also covers project
  `.bb/skills/`).

## Skills

- Use `bb skill list` to inspect installed and discovered skills. It defaults to
  `BB_PROJECT_ID`, then the personal project; pass `--project` or
  `--environment` to select another workspace.
- Copy the opaque ID from `bb skill list`, then use `bb skill show <skill-id>`
  or `bb skill files <skill-id>` to read that exact skill.
- `bb skill show <skill-id> --json` returns the revision. Pass that revision,
  plus `--file`, to `bb skill update <skill-id>`. Use update or delete only when
  the list says editable.
- Use `bb skill search [query]` for live skills.sh results. With no query it
  lists what is trending; `ranking` in the response says which leaderboard you
  got. Install counts match the Skills browse page — lifetime totals, resolved
  per skill on the trending ranking, where the leaderboard's own number counts
  only a 24h window. Resolution is capped at 48 rows per page and a detail page
  can fail to fetch, so read the two surfaces differently: the `INSTALLS`
  column prints `—` for a row it could not resolve, while `--json` lists those
  ids in `unresolvedInstallIds` and leaves their `installs` holding the 24h
  figure. Every other row's `installs` is the lifetime total. Use
  `--per-page 48` or less to avoid unresolved rows. Inspect metadata and the
  bounded file preview with `bb skill registry detail <registry-skill-id>`.
  Install with `bb skill install <registry-skill-id>`; never infer an install
  source from a display name.
- `bb skill install-cli-skills` copies bb's built-in CLI skills into a machine's
  global agent skill roots (`~/.agents/skills` and `~/.claude/skills`) so agents
  outside bb can drive bb. It targets every connected machine unless you pass
  the repeatable `--machine <id-or-name>`, and reports each machine's outcome.
  Settings → Skills has the same action; it confirms first, and asks which
  machines only when more than one is enrolled.
- `bb skill cli-skills-status` reports per machine whether the installed copy is
  `installed`, `outdated`, `missing`, or `unknown` (disconnected or unreachable).

## Spawning Threads

- Use `bb thread spawn --project <project-id> --prompt "..."` to create another
  thread. Pass the intended project explicitly; the CLI does not infer it from
  context variables. Omitted execution flags use remembered project defaults;
  without a remembered model, bb uses the explicitly requested provider or
  Codex and resolves its provider-reported default model on the target machine.
- Add repeatable `--file <path>` / `--image <path>` flags for structured prompt
  attachments, and `--section <id>` to add the new thread to a section. These
  flags pass host-readable absolute paths (or relative server-upload tokens)
  through to the runtime; they do not read files on the CLI machine.
- Spawn creates a root thread unless you pass `--parent-thread`.
- Use `bb thread fork <source-thread-id>` to clone a provider session. The
  fork inherits the source conversation in its timeline. It creates an idle
  fork by default; add `--prompt`, select `--workspace isolated|reuse`, or
  anchor with `--source-seq-end` on a completed source turn (the clone and the
  inherited timeline both end with the turn containing that sequence).
  Permission mode inherits the source thread unless explicitly overridden.
- Pass `--visibility hidden` for background/plugin workers that should remain
  out of sidebar organization without contributing unread/pending favicon
  attention. `bb thread list` excludes them by
  default; pass `--include-hidden` when a hidden worker must be discovered.
  Direct-ID lifecycle and messaging operations remain available. A root thread
  is visible by default; a child thread inherits its parent's visibility, so a
  hidden thread's subagents are hidden too. Pass `--visibility` to override the
  inherited value. A hidden child still reports its turns and blockers to its
  parent thread; only forks and side chats stay silent. Promote or hide an
  existing thread with `bb thread update <id> --visibility visible|hidden`.
- Stop a finished hidden worker with `bb thread stop <id>` to release its agent
  runtime promptly. Archive it first when it no longer belongs in active thread
  lists. Stop preserves the thread and supports a later resume.
- `bb connect --code <code> --server https://<handle>.getbb.app` pairs this bb
  server for browser access at `<handle>.getbb.app` (get the code from
  https://getbb.app). Pairing returns immediately — the
  server itself holds the tunnel and reconnects on restart, so there is no
  foreground process.
  In a source checkout, `pnpm dev` automatically sets
  `BB_DEV_CONNECT_BASE_URL` to the worktree's local Cloud origin. Connect uses
  it only as the unpaired default; explicit `--server` and `--base-url` values
  still win, including when pairing the dev bb with getbb.app.
  `bb connect status` / `bb connect off` report and clear the pairing.
  Port sharing works from a thread on any enrolled host. `bb connect expose
<port>` resolves that thread's environment host and returns its public URL;
  outside a thread it defaults to the server host. Pass `--host
<name-or-id>` to override expose, unexpose, or shares. Server-host URLs use
  the server label; machine-host URLs use the machine label and proxy directly
  through its daemon. Shares are owner-session-gated, not public.
  `bb connect status` shows every share's host and URL; `shares --json` includes
  the resolved host plus `hostId`, `hostName`, `port`, and `url` per row.
  `bb connect servers` lists every bb on the paired account (handle,
  name, url, live) so callers can discover siblings; `--json` includes
  `selfHandle` for deduping this server. When you start a local server the user
  should open remotely, expose the port and give them the share URL.
  `bb connect machine-code` mints a one-time code (10 minutes, single use)
  that pairs the bb mobile app with this bb (it needs the `mobileApp`
  experiment: `bb settings experiment mobileApp true`): it prints the code, server URL,
  connect apex, and expiry; `--json` returns `{code, serverUrl, apex,
expiresAt}`. The phone enrolls as a connect machine with its own revocable
  credential (visible in the getbb.app dashboard). Settings → Remote access →
  Add mobile device shows the same code as a QR. A machine-limit failure names
  the dashboard so the user can revoke an unused device. Remote
  access is owned by the builtin `connect` plugin: `bb plugin disable connect`
  cuts it off entirely; with bb connect still enabled, `bb plugin enable
connect` restores the command. Plugins → Connect shows the current URL, QR
  code, mobile pairing, shared ports, re-pair form, and disconnect control.
- Add remote execution machines from Settings → Machines. Its one-line
  installer stores the bb connect machine credential locally and configures
  both the daemon protocol and agent-launched `bb` CLI to traverse the account
  gate; revoke a lost machine from the getbb.app dashboard. The installer uses
  the server's exact `/install/bb-app.tgz` artifact and uses the npm registry
  only on a 404. It installs under the enrollment's bb data directory, without
  `sudo` or a global npm configuration, and enables daemon `--auto-update`.
  Newer protocol mismatches update that private install with a persisted
  exponential retry backoff from 5 seconds to 5 minutes, then let
  launchd/systemd restart the daemon. Auto-update never downgrades. To bypass a
  transient backoff, use `bb machine retry-update <id-or-name>`. Remove
  `--auto-update` from the service definition and reload it to opt out.
- Run `bb machine list` to see machine names, IDs, connection status, and last
  seen time (`--json` returns the raw host list). Use `--machine <id-or-name>`
  (alias `--host`) on `bb thread spawn` to run in a personal or unmanaged
  workspace, or combine it with `--new-environment worktree`. Do not combine a
  machine selector with an existing environment ID, which already owns its
  machine.
- Each machine carries a permission limit (`maxPermissionMode`, default
  `full`): the highest permission mode a thread on that machine may run with.
  The server resolves any higher request down to it, and refuses a provider
  that supports no mode under it. Only the owner can change it, on the machine
  page at Settings → Machines → the machine — there is no CLI, SDK, or API
  surface that sets it, and machine credentials are refused — so read it from
  `bb machine list --json` or `bb machine show` and ask the user to change it
  in the app.
- `bb machine show`, `join-code`, `rename`, `retry-update`, and `remove` cover
  the Settings → Machines lifecycle. Use `bb machine provider-cli
status|install` to inspect or install provider CLIs on a selected machine.
- `bb updates` (alias for `bb updates status`) aggregates bb-app and provider
  CLI update state across every machine — the CLI counterpart of Settings →
  Updates. `bb updates apply [--machine <id-or-name>]` runs every available
  provider CLI install/update sequentially; update bb-app itself with the
  printed upgrade command or the desktop relaunch.
- Use `bb project create --name <name> --root <path> --machine <id-or-name>`
  to bind a new project's local path to a connected enrolled machine. Use
  `--host` as an alias. Omitting both selectors preserves the existing local
  CLI machine fallback (normally the primary machine).
- `bb project list` preserves the ordinary-project-only default. Pass
  `--include-personal` when the singleton personal project must be discoverable.
- Use `bb project source add <project-id> --machine <id-or-name> --path <path>`
  to register a path on another connected machine. It uses the same selector
  resolution and fallback as project create. Use `--clone` instead of `--path`
  to clone the project's remote there; `--remote-url` and `--target-path` are
  optional clone overrides.
- `bb project paths|files|content|commands` accept `--machine <id-or-name>`
  (`--host` alias) or `--environment <id>`, but not both. An environment uses
  its owning machine and workspace; an explicit machine uses that machine's
  project source; omitting both intentionally uses the primary machine source.
  `bb project content --json` returns UTF-8 text or base64 binary content with
  an explicit `contentEncoding`.
- Use `bb project attachment upload <project-id> --client-file <path>` when the
  bytes live on the CLI machine, including when the CLI and bb server are on
  different hosts. It reads locally and sends multipart bytes through the
  configured `BB_SERVER_URL` (and its enrolled-machine authentication proxy),
  returning the stable server attachment DTO. Optional `--filename` and
  `--mime-type` override inferred metadata. Pass the returned relative `path`
  to thread `--file` or `--image`; image MIME types are capped at 10MB and
  other files at 25MB, and image/heic or image/heif uploads are rejected
  (convert them to JPEG or PNG first). `bb project attachment download <project-id>
<attachment-path> --client-file <path>` writes existing attachment bytes on
  the CLI machine. There is no project-attachment list or per-file remove API.
- `bb project history|reorder` exposes project prompt recall and sidebar order.
- Direct environment inspection accepts any environment ID: use `bb environment
status|branches|paths|diff|diff-files|diff-file|diff-patch <id>` and `bb
environment pull-request show <id>`. Diff commands require an explicit target
  and the matching merge-base or commit flags; all support `--json`.
- `bb environment pull-request ready|draft|merge` manages pull-request state;
  `bb environment archive-threads` bulk-archives an environment's threads.
- Spawned child threads inherit permission from explicit flags, then the
  parent thread's last execution, then project defaults. The parent's mode is
  a hard ceiling: an explicit flag can lower it but never exceed it.
- Public permission modes are `accept-edits`, `auto`, and `full`.
  `accept-edits` keeps workspace sandboxing and asks the user to review
  escalations. `auto` keeps the same workspace sandbox while using the
  provider's automatic reviewer. `full` explicitly bypasses sandbox and
  approval protections. Plan mode remains separate. The product default is
  `auto` when no inherited or project default applies.
- Subagents inherit the parent's permission mode by default;
  `--permission-mode full` only takes effect when the parent itself runs full.
- Use `--parent-self` inside a thread to parent the new thread to the current
  thread.
- Use `--parent-thread <thread-id>` to choose another specific parent.
- A parent can live in a different project. Pass `--project <other-id>` with
  `--parent-self` to delegate work in another repository; the child still
  reports back to its parent and stays under its parent's permission ceiling.
- If provider or model choice matters, inspect options with `bb provider list`
  and `bb provider models <provider-id>`. Both accept `--machine <id-or-name>`
  (alias `--host`) or `--environment <id>` to inspect the machine where work
  will run; the selectors cannot be combined. With neither selector they
  intentionally inspect the primary machine.
- Known ACP agents can appear automatically when their CLI is installed on the
  host; for example `opencode`, `omp`, Grok Build's `grok` CLI, or Hermes'
  `hermes` CLI on PATH appears as provider `acp-opencode`, `acp-omp`,
  `acp-grok`, or `acp-hermes-agent`.
- Cursor ACP threads discover project skills from `.cursor/skills`. This root
  can link to `.agents/skills`. `bb skill list` shows linked Cursor skills under
  `cursor-project` and keeps them read-only.
- Custom ACP agents live in the ACP providers plugin's `customAgents` setting,
  a JSON array: `bb plugin config provider-acp set customAgents '[{"id":"amp",
"displayName":"Amp","command":"amp","args":["acp"]}]'`. The user supplies a
  slug `id`; bb exposes it as provider id `acp-<id>`, which is permanent.
  `cursor` is reserved; `opencode`, `omp`, `grok` and `hermes-agent` are not,
  so an entry with one of those ids replaces the shipped agent. The plugin
  re-registers as soon as the setting changes. The configured command is local code execution and only works with a
  co-located daemon. Optional per-agent fields: `args`, `env`, `cwd`,
  `modelCli`, `reasoningCli`, `nativeReasoning`, `nativeSkillRoots`
  (`{"user": [...], "project": [...]}` relative paths), `permissionCli`,
  `supportsManualCompaction`, and `dialect` (`cursor`, `opencode`, `omp`, or
  `grok`). The old `customAcpAgents` array in `config.json` is deprecated; bb
  reads it and warns until 0.41.
- Top-level `customModels` in the same `config.json` registers extra picker
  models. `providerId` accepts a built-in provider id or any `acp-*` provider
  id. The provider must still accept the id: `claude-code` and `codex` accept
  unlisted ids, while an ACP agent can reject an unknown id at session start.
  OpenCode rejects unlisted ids; add the model to the OpenCode config instead
  and bb discovers it automatically. An OpenCode agent is a session mode, not
  a model, and cannot be selected through bb. This list also has no set/unset
  CLI surface; edit the JSON and run `bb-app config refresh` or restart bb.
  The `streamerMode` General preference hides every entry from model lists.
- Top-level `sharedSkillRoots` uses the same relative `user` and `project`
  paths. bb lists these skills as read-only. bb injects them into each provider,
  so one physical skill collection can support bb and standalone provider CLIs.

Give spawned threads clear prompts: objective, constraints, expected deliverable,
validation to perform, and what to report back. Ask for outcome, changed files
or artifacts, validation performed, and blockers.

## Coordinating Work

- Use one clear owner per task.
- Spawn independent tasks separately when parallel work is useful.
- Let threads work after spawning. Do not poll with shell sleeps, repeated log
  reads, or repeated status reads.
- Use `bb thread wait <thread-id>` when you explicitly need to block until a
  thread finishes. It defaults to waiting for `idle` for up to 20 minutes;
  pass `--status` or `--event` for a different target, and `--timeout
<seconds>` when you need a shorter or longer budget.
- Use `bb thread tell <thread-id> "..."` when requirements change, a blocker
  needs clarification, or follow-up work is needed.
- Add `--plan` to `bb thread spawn` or `bb thread tell` to send the prompt as
  the provider's structured `/plan` action: the agent proposes a plan for
  approval before executing (Claude Code and Codex). Plain `/plan ...` text is
  not recognized and reaches the provider as literal text. Review the proposed
  plan with `bb thread interactions`; `bb thread cancel-plan` leaves Plan mode
  early. The SDK equivalent is `input: [createBuiltinPlanCommandTextInput(text)]`
  (exported by `@bb/sdk`) on `threads.spawn` / `threads.send`.
- Use `bb thread edit-message <thread-id> --message "..."` to replace and rerun
  the latest eligible user message in a Codex, Claude Code, or Pi thread. Pass
  `--expected-request-sequence <sequence>` to select an earlier message. Failed
  and incomplete turns are eligible; submitting against a running thread stops
  and settles its current turn first. Opening edit mode in the app is
  non-destructive; history changes only when the edit is submitted successfully,
  and workspace changes remain. When an agent edits another thread, the CLI
  carries its `BB_THREAD_ID` so the replacement runs under agent permission
  policy.
- `bb thread tell` steers by default, delivering the message immediately into
  the active turn. Use `--mode queue` when the message is non-urgent and the
  agent can finish its current work first. Steer is especially important for a
  wrong direction, hard stop, or critical clarification.
  Example: `bb thread tell <thread-id> "Stop and use approach B" --mode steer`.
- If the target thread is awaiting user interaction (an open question or
  approval), `bb thread tell` cannot interrupt it. The message is held and
  delivers in the requested mode once the interaction settles; the CLI prints
  "message held". That outcome is not a failure, so do not resend. For a hard
  stop use `bb thread stop <thread-id>`. `--json` reports `delivery` as `sent`,
  `queued`, or `deferred`. If the thread fails while the message is held (its
  provider exited), the message waits until somebody retries the thread.

## Inspecting Results

- Use `bb thread search`, `history`, `read|unread`, and `section` for the same
  organization and recall features as the sidebar. `bb thread queue` exposes
  queued-message list/create/update/send/reorder/group/delete operations. Queue
  updates use the listed message version to prevent overwriting a concurrent
  edit and accept repeatable `--file` and `--image` attachment options.
- Use `bb thread show <thread-id>` for status, parent, environment, pull request
  status, and result.
- Use `bb thread show <thread-id> --git-diff` to review file changes.
- Use `bb thread log <thread-id>` to inspect the conversation. The default
  shows only the newest 20 user-message turns and ends with a notice when older
  history was omitted; `--limit <n>` (max 100) widens the window and `--all`
  prints the whole thread. `--json` prints the oldest 100 raw events and warns
  on stderr when more exist; page with `--after-seq <seq>` or pass `--all`.
  Grep the `--all` output, not the default page, when checking whether a
  thread ever received a message.
- Use `bb thread output <thread-id>` to read the latest final output, or
  `bb thread output --self` for the current thread.

For review or fix pipelines, get the environment ID from
`bb thread show <thread-id> --json`, then spawn the follow-up with
`--environment <environment-id>` so it sees the same files.

## Opening Threads And Files In The App

- Use `bb thread open <path>` inside a BB thread to open a Markdown, HTML, or
  other workspace file for the user in the BB IDE's thread panel.
- Use `bb thread open <thread-id> --split right|down|left|top|replace` to open
  or focus a thread in the current app split layout. `replace` is the default;
  an already-open thread is focused. Edge splits create panes through the
  eighth pane; at eight panes, they replace the focused pane.
- A file path is optional when a thread ID is explicit:
  `bb thread open <thread-id> [path] [--split <placement>]`.
- Paths can be thread-relative workspace paths, or absolute paths inside the
  target thread workspace.
- Absolute paths under `BB_THREAD_STORAGE` open as thread-storage files for the
  current thread.
- Use `bb thread pane maximize|restore|toggle [thread-id]` to change a matching
  already-open pane in every connected BB app window. Inside a BB thread, omit
  the id to use `BB_THREAD_ID`. The command reports how many connected clients
  received the ephemeral action. The SDK equivalent is
  `sdk.threads.paneAction({ threadId, action })`.
- Users can also toggle the focused pane from its header or with the configurable
  `pane.maximize.toggle` app command (default `Mod+Shift+E`).

## Files And Voice

- Use `bb file read|write|list|paths|mkdir|move|remove` for SDK-equivalent host
  file access. `--host` targets another machine; `--root` confines mutations.
- Use `bb voice transcribe <file>` to invoke the configured voice transcription
  service without the app composer.

## Long-Running Commands

- Use `bb terminal ...` for long-running commands the user may need to inspect
  or stop later: dev servers, watch tasks, REPLs, database consoles, and similar
  processes. The terminal is a real persistent PTY shown in the bb UI.
- `list` and `create` require exactly one explicit scope: `--thread <id>`,
  `--environment <id>`, or `--machine <id-or-name>` (`--host` is an alias).
  Add `--cwd <path>` only to a machine scope. Machine targets resolve to an
  explicit host ID; terminal commands never silently fall back to primary.
- Start a server with
  `bb terminal create --thread <thread-id> --title "pnpm dev" --command "pnpm dev"`.
- All existing-session operations need only the terminal ID. Use
  `bb terminal wait <terminal-id> --contains "Local:" --timeout 120` to wait
  for readiness from new output. Pass `--from-start` only when matching existing
  scrollback is intentional.
- Use `bb terminal output <terminal-id> --json` to read bounded output, then
  continue with `--since-seq <nextSeq>` when polling. Use
  `bb terminal send <terminal-id> --text "..." --enter` for interactive input,
  `bb terminal rename <terminal-id> <title>` to rename, and
  `bb terminal close <terminal-id>` when the process is no longer needed.
- `bb terminal restart <terminal-id>` replaces the session with a shell in the
  same scope, size, and title. It does not replay the original launch command.

## Failures And Interruptions

- For failed threads, inspect `bb thread show <id> --json` and
  `bb thread log <id>` before deciding whether to retry, clarify, or update the
  user.
- The Provider retry plugin is enabled on fresh installations and automatically
  waits for structured Codex and Claude Code subscription-window resets when
  the failed turn was accepted and its execution settings remain available.
  Prior output or tool activity does not block recovery. Its timers last only
  while the current bb server/plugin process is running. Inspect it
  with `bb provider-retry status [thread-id]`, or cancel one with
  `bb provider-retry cancel <thread-id>`. Automatic waits default to six hours;
  configure longer waits with
  `bb plugin config provider-retry set maximumWait "24 hours"` or select
  `No limit` in the plugin settings. Resets beyond the configured horizon are
  not scheduled. Each reported reset window is attempted automatically at most
  once during that process. A later failed turn that omits a fresh rate-limit
  update can still inherit the last blocked window.
- Use `bb provider-retry retry <thread-id>` for a manual provider retry when no
  plugin timer remains. It sends agent-only “Please continue.” on the existing
  provider conversation and declines when input was not accepted, execution
  settings are unavailable, a newer request exists, or the provider still owns
  the retry.
- For interrupted or stopped threads, inspect first. If the user stopped the
  thread, treat that as intentional unless they ask you to continue.
- Use `bb thread stop <id>` when a thread is stuck or no longer needed.
- `bb thread stop <id>` also releases an idle or stuck agent runtime. The
  command is idempotent and preserves thread history.
- Use `bb thread compact <id>` to send the built-in `/compact` command to an idle or errored thread. Completion or failure appears in the timeline. Codex, Claude Code, Pi, and OpenCode ACP support it; Cursor ACP does not expose compatible compaction through ACP.
- Use `bb thread cancel-plan <id>` to exit an active Plan turn without
  optimistically clearing its banner. Use `bb thread clear-goal <id>` to clear
  a Codex thread's durable active Goal. Both wait for provider confirmation.

## Memory

- Memory is an opt-in official plugin bundled with the app. Install it with
  `bb plugin install memory` before using `bb memory ...`.
- Use `bb memory catalog` to inspect the compact index, `bb memory search
<query>` to find candidates, and `bb memory get <id>` to progressively
  disclose a full record.
- Use `bb memory add --scope project ...` for repository-specific knowledge.
  Global writes require an explicit `--scope global` and should be reserved
  for durable preferences or facts that apply across projects.
- Mutations use optimistic concurrency: pass the current record version to
  `bb memory update <id> --expected-version <n>` or `bb memory forget <id>
--expected-version <n> --reason <text>`.

## Tasks

- Tasks is an opt-in official plugin bundled with the app. Install it with
  `bb plugin install tasks` before using `bb tasks ...`.
- Start tracked work with `bb tasks show <key-or-id> --json`. Fetch relevant
  files with `bb tasks attachment get <attachment-id> --out <path>`.
- Leave substantive milestone updates with `bb tasks comment <key-or-id>
--body <markdown>` and attach result artifacts with `bb tasks attachment
add <key-or-comment-id> --file <path>` (task key = task-level; comment ID
  = that comment). Avoid progress spam.
- Delegated threads are attached automatically. For work started independently,
  run `bb tasks attach <key-or-id>` from the working thread. When a thread is
  done with a task or a respawned worker replaced it, run `bb tasks detach
<key-or-id> [--thread <thread-id>]`. `bb tasks threads <key>` lists live
  threads first, newest first.
- When implementation is ready for review, run `bb tasks update <key-or-id>
--status in_review`; if blocked, leave the status accurate and explain the
  blocker in a comment.
- Change task hierarchy with `bb tasks update <key-or-id> --parent
<parent-key-or-id>` or promote a subtask with `--no-parent`. The flags are
  mutually exclusive, and both task keys and IDs are accepted.
- Add `--json` when command output will drive follow-up work. Run `bb tasks
--help` for project, folder, task, label, attachment, preset, delegation,
  attached-thread, and demo-data commands.
- `bb tasks list` defaults to 100 rows and accepts `--limit 1-500` plus the
  opaque `--cursor` returned as `nextCursor` in JSON (or printed after a human
  page). Keep the same filters and sort. A task-list mutation makes the cursor
  stale; restart without it.

## Docs

- Docs is an opt-in official plugin. Keep read-only discovery small with
  `bb docs vaults`, `list`, and `read`.
- Edit through a sync workspace: `bb docs pull <path> --into <dir>` for one
  file, add `--folder` for a subtree, or use `bb docs pull --all`. Edit the
  resulting ordinary files, inspect `bb docs status <dir> --diff`, then run
  `bb docs push <dir>`.
- `.bb-docs-state.json` is versioned identity/concurrency state; do not edit it.
  Concurrent local and remote changes fail closed with exit 3. Pull and merge,
  then retry.
- Local deletions are ignored unless `push --delete` is explicit. Use
  `push --dry-run --diff` before destructive mirroring. Standalone callers can
  select the local workspace machine with `--workspace-host <id>`.
- Direct `write`, `mkdir`, `move`, and `remove` commands are deprecated and
  retained temporarily for compatibility. Agents should use pull/edit/push.

## Automations

- Use `bb automation ...` to manage scheduled tasks. This command is provided
  by the builtin `automations` plugin. When due, an automation runs in one of
  two modes: `agent` (spawns a thread running a prompt — uses tokens) or
  `script` (runs a stored command and captures stdout/exit — no agent, no
  tokens).
- Choosing a mode: pick `script` when the output is fully determined by code
  (watchdogs, threshold alerts, health checks, pollers with a fixed output) —
  write the check so it prints nothing when there's nothing to report, so quiet
  ticks stay silent. Pick `agent` when the run needs reasoning (summarize,
  triage, draft for a human, branch on content).
- For a "watch X and alert me when Y" request, prefer a script automation:
  author the check script (inline `--script` or a file via `--script-file`) so
  its stdout IS the alert, then create it — no model spend per tick.
- Script automations may be disabled by the plugin setting; fall back to an
  `agent` automation if script creation is rejected.
- Create an agent automation with
  `bb automation create --project <id> --name "..." --cron "0 9 * * 1-5" --timezone "America/New_York" --provider <id> --model <model> --reasoning <level> --service-tier <default|fast> --prompt "..."`.
- Create a one-shot agent automation with
  `bb automation create --project <id> --name "..." --in "30m" --provider <id> --model <model> --prompt "..."`,
  or use `--at "2026-07-03T09:00:00-07:00"` for an absolute run time.
- Create a script automation with
  `bb automation create --project <id> --name "..." --cron "..." --timezone "..." --script-file ./watch.sh`
  (or `--script "<inline>"`). A script that exits 0 with empty stdout, or whose
  last non-empty line is `{"wakeAgent": false}`, stays silent.
- `--script-file` reads the file relative to your cwd from the thread's
  environment host (the server host outside a thread; `--host <name-or-id>`
  overrides) and stores a private copy that runs execute. The copy is a
  snapshot: edits to the source file do nothing until you run
  `bb automation update <id> --project <id> --script-file <path>` again with
  the same script flags; `create` and `update` print that exact command.
  `create`, `update`, and `show` print the stored copy path on the `Script:`
  line (`execution.storedScriptPath` in `--json`).
- Script automations run on the server with cwd set to the plugin data
  directory. They have no environment/workspace. Injected variables are
  `BB_SERVER_URL`, `BB_PROJECT_ID`, `BB_AUTOMATION_ID`, and
  `BB_AUTOMATION_RUN_ID`.
- A script run's status IS its exit code: exit 0 = succeeded; a non-zero exit is
  recorded as failed even if the script already produced a visible side effect
  (e.g. posted a message via `bb thread tell`). Make scripts exit 0 on success
  and check the exit status of each `bb` call. Captured stdout+stderr is stored
  on failed runs (see `--output <run-id>`).
- Cron accepts standard 5-field expressions, including step values like
  `* * * * *`, `*/2 * * * *`, and `*/5 * * * *`. Cron granularity is one
  minute. One-shot automations use `--at` or `--in` and fire once.
- Pass `--project <id>` explicitly for every automation command.
- Use `bb automation list`, `bb automation show <id>`, and
  `bb automation runs <id>` to inspect; `--output <run-id>` prints a script
  run's captured stdout.
- Partially update an existing agent automation in place with any of
  `--prompt`, `--provider`, `--model`, `--reasoning`,
  `--service-tier default|fast|none`, `--permission-mode accept-edits|auto|full`,
  or exactly one
  target option:
  `--target-thread <id>`, `--environment <id-or-path>`, or
  `--new-environment worktree [--base-branch <branch>]`. Omitted execution
  fields are preserved; target options are mutually exclusive.
  Pass provider, model, reasoning, service tier, and permission together when
  switching providers.
- Use `bb automation pause <id>` / `bb automation resume <id>` to toggle,
  `bb automation run <id>` to trigger now, and `bb automation delete <id> --yes`
  to remove.
- Use `bb automation update <id> --project <id>` with `--name` or schedule
  flags for metadata changes. To change what runs, provide a complete
  replacement execution: `--prompt` + `--provider` + `--model` for an agent,
  with optional `--reasoning` and `--service-tier`, or
  `--script`/`--script-file` for a script. Script replacements also accept
  `--interpreter`, `--timeout`, and `--env-json '{"KEY":"value"}'`.
- Use `bb plugin list` if `bb automation ...` is unavailable; the builtin
  automations plugin should be installed and running.

## Secrets

- Use `bb secret request <NAME...> --write-env <path>` when credentials are
  needed. Batch known names and add `--purpose <text>` plus one
  `--describe <NAME> <text>` per variable.
- The user enters values in a secure plugin form; values are written directly
  to the dotenv file and never returned in CLI output or chat. Relative paths
  resolve from the CLI working directory; absolute paths may point anywhere on
  the thread's host.
- Treat the returned path and added/updated/unchanged counts as verification.
  Do not inspect the completed file with `cat`, `sed`, `env`, or similar tools.

## Ask User Question

- The builtin `ask-user-question` plugin gives providers that lack a native
  one an `AskUserQuestion` tool — multiple-choice questions answered in a
  composer form. It is disabled on fresh installations; enable it under
  Extensions → Plugins or with `bb plugin enable ask-user-question`.
- It contributes no CLI command. Once enabled the tool appears in the agent's
  own tool list, and only for providers without a native equivalent: Claude
  Code threads keep using Claude's built-in `AskUserQuestion`, so the plugin
  withholds its copy there.
- `bb thread interactions list <thread-id>` shows the request as kind
  `plugin`; `bb thread interactions answer` resolves provider questions
  only. Answer a plugin form — a plugin's own request, or a request the agent
  raised through a provider (kind `<pluginId>/<name>`) — with
  `bb thread interactions respond <interaction-id> [thread-id] --value '<json>'`;
  `bb thread interactions show <interaction-id>` prints the form's data so
  you can shape the value.

## Workflows

- The builtin `workflows` plugin runs durable provider-independent JavaScript
  orchestration and is disabled on fresh installations. Enable it under
  Extensions → Plugins or with `bb plugin enable workflows` before using its
  command.
- Author and check sources with `bb workflows validate (--script <javascript>|
--source <javascript>|--file <path>|--name <name>)`; start a background run
  with the same selector via `bb workflows run ... [--args <json>] [--resume
<run-id>]`.
- Poll compact progress with `bb workflows status <run-id>` and list compact
  run summaries with `bb workflows list [--limit <1-50>]`. For details,
  redirect one bounded
  `bb workflows history <run-id> [--cursor <call-index>] [--limit <1-100>]`
  JSONL page into `$BB_THREAD_STORAGE`, inspect it with file tools, and continue
  from the final page record's `nextCursor`. This shell redirection writes on
  the thread's execution host, including remote hosts; do not print the raw
  history into the agent transcript. Cancel with `bb workflows stop <run-id>`.
- Before choosing an explicit provider/model/reasoning tuple, run `bb provider
list --environment "$BB_ENVIRONMENT_ID" --json`, then query only the chosen
  provider with `bb provider models <provider-id> --environment
"$BB_ENVIRONMENT_ID" --json`. Never guess ACP model IDs. Run every Workflows
  command from a BB project thread.
- Configure its six settings with `bb plugin config workflows set <key>
<value>`: `maxActiveRuns` (default 4, range 1–32), `maxConcurrentAgents` (8,
  1–64), `maxAgentCalls` (100, 1–1000), `totalRunTimeoutMs` (86400000,
  60000–604800000),
  `retentionDays` (30, 1–3650), and `maxNotificationBytes` (16384,
  1024–262144). `maxActiveRuns` applies live; the other five are snapshotted per
  run. No plugin reload is needed after changing them.

## Theming

- `bb theme` controls the **app-wide color palette** — a set of CSS-variable
  overrides persisted server-side and applied live to every open window. This is
  the _palette_ only; light/dark _mode_ is a separate per-client setting that the
  palette layers on top of.
- **Custom themes live on disk** under the app data dir, one folder per theme:
  `<bb-data-dir>/theme/<name>/theme.css` (the packaged app uses `~/.bb/theme/…`).
  The folder name _is_ the theme id. This mirrors how user skills live under
  `<bb-data-dir>/skills/<name>/`.
- Commands:
  - `bb theme list` — built-in and custom themes and which palette is active.
  - `bb theme dir` — print the absolute custom-theme directory (where to create
    `<name>/theme.css`). Use this instead of guessing the path.
  - `bb theme set <id> [--favicon-color <color>]` — activate a built-in
    (`default`, `nord`, `dracula`, `solarized`, `gruvbox`, `catppuccin`), custom,
    or plugin-contributed theme. Without the flag it preserves the favicon
    color; with the flag it updates the complete appearance selection.
  - `bb theme show [--css]` — print the active palette; `--css` dumps the active
    theme's CSS.
  - `bb theme reset` — back to `default` while preserving the favicon color.
  - `bb theme favicon set <color>` — set the favicon color while preserving the
    active theme. Colors: `default`, `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `teal`,
    `blue`, `purple`, `pink`.
  - `bb theme favicon reset` — reset the favicon color to `default` while
    preserving the active theme.

### Creating or editing a custom theme

This is the BB habit: custom app-theme work belongs in
`<bb-data-dir>/theme/<name>/theme.css` — never a stray `.css` file elsewhere.

1. Find the directory: `bb theme dir` (e.g. `~/.bb/theme`).
2. Write the stylesheet to `<that-dir>/<name>/theme.css` (create the folder). Use
   a short, lowercase, hyphenated `<name>` (it must not collide with a built-in
   id). To edit an existing theme, change its `theme.css` in place.
3. Activate it: `bb theme set <name>`. Changes apply live to every open window.

Code colors follow the active palette. Built-in palettes use the matching
Shiki pair (Nord, Dracula, Solarized, Gruvbox, Catppuccin). To restyle diffs
for a custom palette, put Pierre / VS Code theme JSON next to the stylesheet:

- `pierre-dark.json` and `pierre-light.json` in the same folder, or
- `theme.json` with `{ "codeTheme": { "dark": "…", "light": "…" } }` — each
  side is a bundled Shiki name (`github-dark`) or a folder-relative `.json`
  file.

See [Pierre theme authoring](https://diffs.com/theme) for the JSON shape.

To author the stylesheet, **read `references/theming.md` (in this skill's
directory) first.** It is the full design-token reference — what every CSS
variable drives, which tokens to set vs. which auto-derive — plus the two-block
light/dark structure, how to set colors and fonts, and a worked example.

The short version: a custom theme is a plain CSS file that overrides CSS custom
properties. Set the two anchors `--canvas`/`--ink` (most of the UI derives from
them by mixing ink into canvas), the `--primary` accent, the secondary text tiers
(`--muted-foreground` etc.), and the semantic colors (`--destructive`,
`--success`, …). Ship one file with a `:root, .light` block and a `.dark` block.

## Plugins

- A bb plugin is a TypeScript package running inside the bb server, extending
  it with services, schedules, HTTP/RPC endpoints, settings — and `bb` CLI
  subcommands that agents run through bash like any other command.
- Plugins are on by default. Auto-installed builtin plugins ship with bb
  (except `side-chat`, which is gated by the **"Side chat plugin"**
  experiment); official plugins install from the bundled store on demand.
- **BB Official plugins** (store under `/api/v1/plugin-catalog`):
  - BB's official plugins (GitHub, Docs, Memory, and Tasks) ship
    bundled inside the app and install from the local copy — no network. Installed official
    plugins are pinned to the bundled copy and update with BB app releases.
  - The store also lists the **BB Community marketplace** catalog: a manifest
    the server re-reads at startup and every two hours from
    `https://getbb.app/marketplace/v1/marketplace.json`
    (override with `BB_MARKETPLACE_URL`, which the server reads only at
    startup). Its entries install from their listed
    git or npm source through the normal install pipeline. A refresh only
    updates discovery metadata and icons; it never installs, updates, or runs
    plugin code, and a failed refresh keeps the last catalog bb validated.
  - `bb plugin search <query> [--json]` — search the official plugins by id,
    name, description, category, or tag; status shows installed / compatible /
    requires newer bb. An **Installs** column appears once the curated
    marketplace's `stats.json` sidecar has been read (`installs` in `--json`,
    null when unknown): anonymous-telemetry install counts, published only for
    bundled plugins and `bb-community` entries, never for third-party ones.
- **Third-party marketplaces** (routes under `/api/v1/marketplaces`):
  - `bb marketplace add <source>` — add a marketplace from an https manifest
    URL, `git:<url>[@<ref>]` (bb reads `marketplace.json` from the checkout),
    or `path:<directory>` on the bb server's machine. bb validates the
    manifest, caches the catalog, and fetches its icons. **Adding a
    marketplace installs nothing.** The manifest's own `name` is the
    marketplace's identity, so a name collision is refused; `bb-community` is
    reserved and can be neither added nor removed.
  - `bb marketplace list [--json]` — name, source, entry count, last refresh.
  - `bb marketplace refresh [name] [--json]` — re-read one catalog or every
    one of them. Discovery metadata and icons only. A failed refresh keeps the
    last catalog bb validated and exits non-zero.
  - `bb marketplace remove <name> [--json]` — forget a marketplace. Its
    catalog rows and cached icons are deleted; every plugin it listed keeps
    running as a direct install with its full source intent and exact
    resolution, so `bb plugin outdated`/`update` keep working from the
    recorded source.
  - Install a specific marketplace's entry with
    `bb plugin install <entry-id>@<marketplace>`. A bare entry id resolves
    across every marketplace: exactly one match installs, no match falls back
    to the bundled official plugin of that name, and several matches fail and
    list the `id@marketplace` choices.
  - Installing from a marketplace other than `bb-community` first resolves and
    prints the true source — npm package with its range or dist-tag, or git
    URL with its ref or semver range, subdirectory, and the exact release tag
    and commit that range currently lands on — plus the marketplace and the
    entry's author. `--yes` skips the prompt, not the resolution. The install
    fails if the listing or its resolved git commit changes after confirmation.
- Commands:
  - `bb plugin install <src>` — official plugin name (github, docs, memory,
    tasks), `<entry-id>@<marketplace>`, HTTP(S) Git repository URL, local
    path, `builtin:<name>`,
    `git:<url>[@<ref|semver-range>]`, or `npm:<package>[@<version|tag|range>]`
    (npm on PATH required for `npm:`). Repository URLs and prefixes `path:` /
    `npm:` / `git:` / `builtin:` skip official-plugin resolution. To pin or
    range an npm package, install with `npm:<package>@…`.
    Omit the npm spec to track compatible stable releases; ranges and dist-tags
    track, while exact versions are pinned. Omit the Git ref to track the
    repository's default branch; explicit branches track, while tags and
    commits are pinned. A Git semver range
    (`git:github.com/acme/repo@^1.2.0`) tracks the repository's `vX.Y.Z` tags,
    picking the highest release the range allows and excluding prereleases
    unless the range names one. `--tag-prefix <prefix>` ranges over
    `<prefix>vX.Y.Z` tags instead, for a repository that versions each plugin
    on its own. bb records the selected tag and its commit and refuses to
    resolve that tag again if it moved. A bare spec that reads as a range
    resolves over tags only when no branch or tag has that literal name; when
    both exist the install fails — write `@semver:<range>` or `@ref:<name>`.
    Installs prompt for confirmation (plugins are full-trust code);
    pass `--yes` to skip. Reinstalling an already-installed managed plugin is
    refused — use `bb plugin update`. Installing a local path for an id that
    is already installed from another local path moves the plugin to the new
    directory and keeps its settings, secrets, and schedules. Plugins that
    declare a frontend (`bb.app`) are built at install time for path sources
    and git sources without a prebuilt app when their imported dependencies
    are already available;
    git/npm packages can also ship a metadata-validated prebuilt `dist/`, and
    npm packages must. Managed git/npm installs refuse `engines.bb` /
    `engines.bbPluginSdk` mismatches, manifest vs. artifact identity mismatches,
    and ids reserved by bundled plugins.
    A `git:`/`path:` repository can hold several plugins. Install one with
    `--subdirectory <relative-path>`, or with `--plugin <name>` to resolve an
    entry of the repository's `.bb/plugins.json` collection manifest (the two
    flags are mutually exclusive, and neither applies to `npm:`/`builtin:`
    sources). Installs from one repository and commit share a single checkout.
    A repository that has a collection manifest and is not a plugin itself
    refuses an unselected install and lists its entry names.
  - `bb plugin outdated` — check installed plugins for compatible updates
    (table; `--json` for raw results). Shows latest compatible candidate and
    any blocked incompatible newer release. Dev builds (bb `0.0.0`) annotate
    that `engines.bb` is not enforced.
  - `bb plugin update <id>` / `bb plugin update --all` — apply compatible
    updates for tracking sources, including newer tags that satisfy a Git
    semver range. Same full-trust confirmation as install (`--yes` skips;
    non-TTY refuses without it). Use `bb plugin outdated` to preview available
    updates. Changing a pinned git:/npm: source requires `bb plugin remove`
    (which deletes the plugin's settings, secrets, and schedules) and a fresh
    install. A local path plugin is never removed to change it: edit it in
    place and `bb plugin reload <id>`, or `bb plugin install path:<new dir>`
    to move it; both keep its configuration.
  - `bb plugin list` — status, background services, schedules, handler timings,
    and each plugin's contributed `bb` command.
  - `bb plugin source <id> [--json]` — requested and resolved source, the
    repository subdirectory for a nested plugin, the semver range with its tag
    prefix and resolved tag for a Git range install, engine ranges, install
    time, integrity/registry details, and recent activation history.
  - `bb plugin enable|disable <id>`, `bb plugin reload [id]` (exits 1 when a
    reloaded plugin does not come up on its current sources: the previous
    instance was kept, or it is degraded because a service ignored its abort),
    `bb plugin remove <id>` (deletes the plugin's settings, secrets, and
    schedules; managed git/npm files are deleted, local path sources stay on
    disk, builtin removals are remembered).
  - `bb plugin config <id> [set <key> <value> | unset <key>]` — declared
    settings. Reload the plugin after configuring (`bb plugin reload <id>`).
  - `bb plugin logs <id> [-n N] [-f]` — the plugin's `bb.log` output.
  - `bb plugin run <id> [args...]` — explicit form; collisions log an activation
    warning and are annotated by `bb plugin list`.
  - `bb plugin new <name>` — scaffold a todo-list plugin (`server.ts`,
    `app.tsx` with a sidebar page, a `bb <name>` CLI command, a skill, and
    vendored UI components) and install its npm dependencies (scaffold sets
    `engines.bbPluginSdk` to `>=0.4.3`). The
    scaffold depends on `@get-bb/plugin-sdk`, pinned to this bb's exact SDK
    version in `devDependencies`, so the API declarations arrive with
    `npm install` at `node_modules/@get-bb/plugin-sdk/bundled-types/*.d.ts`
    (no vendored `types/`). If that version is not on npm yet, it warns and
    still scaffolds. The
    install is best-effort and verified: if npm is missing or leaves a package
    out, it says so and prints the manual `npm install --include=dev` step
    rather than reporting success; `bb plugin build [path]` —
    compile the plugin into `dist/`: the backend bundle (`server.js` +
    `server.meta.json` stamped with SDK/identity metadata; preferred by
    git/npm installs over source), when `bb.app` is declared, `app.js` +
    `app.css` + `app.meta.json`, and, when `bb.host` is declared, the
    self-contained host artifact `host.js` + `host.js.map` +
    `host.meta.json` (its digest; host daemons download and verify the bundle
    by that digest, and run it as a host RPC worker, a provider bridge, or
    both). None of it needs the server.
  - `bb plugin types [path]` — sync the plugin's `@get-bb/plugin-sdk` surface
    to the running bb (default: cwd). For a plugin that depends on the npm
    package it rewrites the exact `devDependencies` pin to this bb's SDK
    version and brings the type-only devDependencies of the packages bb shims
    at runtime (sonner, vaul, the portal radix families, @pierre/diffs, clsx,
    tailwind-merge, class-variance-authority) to this bb's versions — adding
    any an app plugin is missing and moving one out of `dependencies`
    (reporting old → new, and reminding you to `npm install`); for a
    plugin that still vendors declarations it rewrites `types/*.d.ts`, creating
    `types/` when absent. Run it in a cloned or older plugin: the SDK surface
    grows every release. `--check` writes nothing and exits non-zero on a
    mismatch (for CI). `bb plugin build` and `bb plugin dev` refresh vendored
    declarations automatically and leave npm-package plugins alone. Needs no
    server.
  - `bb plugin migrate [path] [--yes]` — convert a plugin that still vendors
    `types/` to the `@get-bb/plugin-sdk` npm package (default: cwd): add the
    exact `devDependencies` pin, raise `engines.bbPluginSdk` when this bb's SDK
    is newer than the declared floor, move an SDK entry declared in
    `dependencies` into `devDependencies`, drop the `@get-bb/plugin-sdk` (and
    pre-rename `@bb/plugin-sdk`) entries from `compilerOptions.paths` (other
    paths like `@/*` are untouched), and delete `types/bb-plugin-sdk*.d.ts`
    plus `types/` if that empties it — a `types/` still holding your own
    declarations is kept, along with the `include` entries that compile it. It
    also rewrites quoted `@bb/plugin-sdk` import/export specifiers (and their
    subpaths) in the plugin's own `.ts`/`.tsx` sources to `@get-bb/plugin-sdk`,
    skipping `node_modules/`, `dist/`, and `types/`; the path map was what made
    the old name resolve, so the imports move with it. A
    half-migrated plugin that has no vendored artifacts left but never gained
    the pin is completed the same way. It
    prints the exact plan and asks before touching anything; `--yes` is
    required when stdin is not a terminal, where it otherwise prints the plan
    and exits non-zero having changed nothing. Run `npm install` afterwards.
    The vendored layout keeps working, so nothing migrates unless you ask.
    Re-running on a migrated plugin is a no-op. Needs no server.
  - `bb plugin dev [path]` — watch loop for an installed plugin (default:
    cwd): on every change it rebuilds the frontend bundle (when `bb.app` is
    declared; unminified, unlike `bb plugin build`) and reloads the plugin;
    open app pages pick the new UI up live.
    Build/reload failures print and keep watching; Ctrl+C stops.
  - Frontend entries default-export `definePluginApp` from
    `@get-bb/plugin-sdk/app` and register UI slots (homepageSection,
    settingsSection, navPanel, threadPanelAction, fileOpener) with hooks
    (useRpc, useRealtime, useRealtimeConnectionState,
    useSettings, useBbContext,
    useBbNavigate, useComposer for scoped text editing / quote / mention /
    focus access); components are vendored shadcn source the
    plugin owns. Installed
    plugins and their settings also appear under Extensions → Plugins.
- Plugins can add top-level `bb` subcommands (e.g. `bb linear issues`). Run
  them directly — unknown `bb` commands are resolved against installed plugins
  and proxied to the server. Core command names always win. In agent threads,
  the injected `plugin-commands` skill lists what is available.
- Plugin commands share a 1,048,576-byte combined stdout/stderr ceiling. An
  oversized result is rejected in full as `plugin_cli_output_too_large` (valid
  JSON for `--json` callers), never truncated. Use pagination or file/streaming
  commands for large results.
- **Writing a plugin?** Use the `bb-plugin-authoring` skill — the complete
  authoring reference for the backend `BbPluginApi` (settings, storage, sdk,
  http/rpc/realtime, background services and schedules, CLI commands, agent
  tools and context, host-rendered UI, lifecycle) and the frontend
  `@get-bb/plugin-sdk/app` contract (slots, hooks, UI kit), with working patterns
  and gotchas. `bb guide plugins` has the short walkthrough.
