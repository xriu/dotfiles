# Confluence Content

Use the unified `confluence content` surface for supported content operations.
Inspect live help because available content types and operations can differ by
build profile.

## Content Types

- `live_doc`: use for collaborative or likely co-authored internal content when
  supported, including working docs, plans, meeting notes, and status updates.
  Bare "page," "test page," and "Confluence page" requests also default here;
  asking for the resulting page URL does not imply classic content.
- `page`: use only for explicit classic/non-live intent, including "classic
  page," "non-live page," "not a live doc," or an exact `--content-type page`
  instruction; also use for knowledge bases, customer-facing help, established
  classic-page spaces, and verified page-only operations.
- `blogpost`: dated posts and announcements.
- `folder`: hierarchy-only containers.
- `whiteboard` and `database`: specialized formats when the build advertises
  support.

Preserve an existing mutation target's type. A classic parent or reference page
does not determine a new child's type.

For known content, use the native get command with the stable ID or URL. Request
full body, comments, versions, or permissions only when the task needs them.

## Persisted Remix Infographics

A saved Remix infographic is exposed as an attachment on its owning page. Resolve
and download it with the existing content attachment commands:

```bash
twg confluence content attachments list \
  --id <content-id> \
  --filename <media-file-id> \
  --site <site> \
  -o json

twg confluence content attachments download \
  --attachment-id <id-from-list-result> \
  --out <local-path> \
  --site <site>
```

The first command's matching `id` is the Confluence attachment ID. It is not the
Remix `mediaFileId`; passing `mediaFileId` directly to `--attachment-id` fails
validation or lookup. Do not invent a Media Platform URL or substitute the
attachment result's internal `fileId`.

To read the generated AI summary for document content, request the dedicated
detail mode:

```bash
twg confluence content get <ID-or-URL> --detail ai_summary -o json --site <site>
```

Read `data.aiSummary`. It is a string when a generated summary exists and
`null` when one is unavailable; this mode never falls back to the standard
page excerpt. Do not use it for whiteboards, databases, embeds, folders, or
smart links because non-document content rejects `--detail`.

## Non-doc Read-back And Whiteboard Rendering

Non-doc body formats hydrate their bodies through `--format`, not `--detail`:

```bash
# Editable persisted whiteboard SVG.
twg confluence content get <ID-or-URL> \
  --format svg \
  -o json \
  --output-file /tmp/whiteboard.json \
  --site <site>
jq -r '.data.body.value' /tmp/whiteboard.json > /tmp/whiteboard.svg

# Persisted database rows and fields.
twg confluence content get <ID-or-URL> \
  --format csv \
  -o json \
  --output-file /tmp/database.json \
  --site <site>
jq -r '.data.body.value' /tmp/database.json > /tmp/database.csv
```

Do not add `--detail` to whiteboard, database, embed, or smart-link body reads;
those content types reject it. For whiteboard visual verification, request the
rendered PNG explicitly:

```bash
twg confluence content get <ID-or-URL> \
  --format png \
  --output json \
  --site <site> > /tmp/whiteboard-png.json
```

The response contains a short-lived signed media URL, normally in
`data.body.value`. Download the bytes behind that URL to a `.png` file, open the
file, and inspect the rendered layout before claiming visual verification.
`--output-file` writes the full command payload, including the returned PNG URL.
A URL alone is not visual proof.

## Embed And Smart Link Reads

An `embed` or `smart_link` stores a destination URL rather than the destination's
content. Resolve the destination, route it by product or provider, and verify any
connector result by provider identity.

1. Read the Confluence item with `--format url`. Keep its title and destination
   from `data.body.value`.

   ```bash
   twg confluence content get <content-ID> --format url --site <site> \
     -o json --agent-fields data.title,data.body
   ```

   Omit `--detail`; embed and smart-link reads reject it. If a browser URL form
   fails validation, pass the numeric content ID from it.

2. Route the destination by product or provider before searching. Embeds commonly
   point at Atlassian content or ordinary web pages, and neither is a connector
   lookup.

   | Destination                                                                                     | Action                                                                                          |
   | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | A Confluence path such as `<site>.atlassian.net/wiki/...`                                       | Read it with `twg confluence content get "<url>"`. Do not search Rovo.                           |
   | A Jira issue path such as `<site>.atlassian.net/browse/<KEY>`                                   | Read it with `twg jira workitem get <KEY> --site <site>`. Do not search Rovo.                    |
   | Another Atlassian product                                                                       | Hand off to that product's native skill and command when available; otherwise report and stop.  |
   | A connector-backed provider such as `docs.google.com` or `drive.google.com` for `google-drive` | Continue to step 3.                                                                             |
   | Anything else, including public sites                                                           | Report the destination as an external link and stop. Do not search Rovo.                         |

3. Search that connector by the exact title as stored in Confluence. Preserve
   the whole title, including prefixes such as `Copy of `. If the quoted search
   returns no canonical match, retry once unquoted with the same complete title.
   Do not broaden further. Raw provider URLs and document IDs have poor search
   recall.

   ```bash
   twg rovo search '"<title>"' --app <connector> --limit 20 \
     -o json --agent-fields @evidence
   ```

4. Compare each candidate's stable provider resource ID with the destination.
   Ignore query parameters and fragments. Compare recognizable path IDs
   directly; use `twg resolve "<url>"` only when the URL forms do not expose a
   clear identifier. A matching title alone is insufficient.

For a read-only summary request, an exact provider resource ID match is
sufficient to summarize that result's indexed text or snippets. Explicitly say
that the summary may be partial or stale; do not present it as a full live read
of the provider document.

Keep the Confluence title and provider title as separate evidence. If they
differ, report both and do not rewrite either title.

Treat returned Rovo text or snippets as indexed, potentially partial or stale
content. `twg docs get` is not a direct provider lookup: it scans the caller's
recent-activity projection and may return metadata instead of the body.

For a connector destination with no canonical match after the bounded title
retry, report that connector availability, indexing, permissions, or search
recall may be incomplete; indexing also lags document creation, so a recently
added document may resolve on a later attempt. Do not substitute a similar
result.

Smart Folder children each carry their own destination and route independently.
Children of one folder routinely land in different branches of step 2, so
classify every child on its own rather than inferring its kind from a sibling.

## Writes

- Supply the title through the title option, not as the first body heading.
- Use body files for multiline or structured content.
- Resolve the destination space and parent before create, move, or copy.
- Read current state before update or delete.
- Verify the created or changed entity and report its stable URL.

For Share dialog access changes, map General access through
`restriction-state`: `Open, Anyone in this space can edit` -> `OPEN`; `Open,
Anyone in this space can view` -> `EDIT_RESTRICTED`; and `Restricted, Only
specific people can view or edit` -> `VIEW_RESTRICTED`. Map Specific access
through direct `permissions`: `Can edit` -> `update` and `Can view` -> `read`.
Specific access grants add access; they do not restrict other principals or
change General access. Each principal holds exactly one direct level, and
`update` already includes `read`/view.

`content create --private` already sets General access to `VIEW_RESTRICTED` and
gives the creator `update`. Do not add `read` for that creator: it is redundant
for viewing and would replace edit access. For existing content, ensure the
caller has `update` before setting General access away from `OPEN`; the server
rejects a state change that would lock the caller out.

Copy operations may copy only the selected entity rather than descendants.
Inspect the exact contract and do not imply a subtree copy without evidence.

## Comments

- `comments list` returns footer and inline comments when `--comment-type` is omitted.
- Each list invocation returns one agentic API page. `--limit` accepts 1-250 and defaults to 50;
  it is a page size, not an all-results cap. If JSON `data.nextCursor` is present, pass that value
  to the next invocation with `--cursor` and continue until `nextCursor` is absent.
- Pass `--include-replies true` to list nested replies; `comments get` includes replies by default.
- List/get `--body-format` accepts `md` or `markdown` for Markdown, and `html` for HTML.
- Create requires `--comment-type footer|inline`. Inline comments also require
  `--text-selection`; use the match index/count flags when the selected text repeats.
- Get, update, resolve, and reopen auto-detect the type when `--comment-type` is omitted.
- Use `--expected-version` on update when the current version is known. A stale version is
  returned as a structured `version_conflict` failure.
- Delete can return `blockingReplyIds` and guidance. Delete those replies before retrying.

## Exports

Export behavior depends on the requested format:

- Word export is synchronous and returns the download URL directly.
- PDF export starts an asynchronous task. Capture the returned task ID, poll
  the export-status command, and return the download URL after completion.

Do not poll Word exports, and do not treat the initial PDF task response as a
completed export.

## Downloading A Persisted Remix Infographic

Use the existing attachment commands. List the owning page's attachments with
`confluence content attachments list --id <content-id> --filename <media-file-id>`,
then pass the matching result's attachment `id` to
`confluence content attachments download --attachment-id <attachment-id> --out <path>`.
Do not pass `mediaFileId` directly as `--attachment-id`; the two IDs are different.
