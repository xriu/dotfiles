# Agent Output

Agent invocations should call the installed `twg` binary directly:

```bash
twg <command>
```

When the host sets `TWG_AGENT_DEFAULTS=1` in the process environment, the CLI
treats non-help commands as agent-mode calls, defaults missing output to JSON,
and writes large payloads to files while keeping stdout compact. Do not prefix
individual commands with `TWG_AGENT_DEFAULTS=1` unless the host explicitly asks
for that shape; env-prefixed shell commands can bypass command-specific
authorization in some agent runtimes.

The CLI core applies the same file-backed protection for direct structured
agent calls such as `twg --mode agent --output json work query`. It only applies
when the caller has not explicitly chosen `--output-summary`, `--output-file`, or
`--output text`. Use `--output-summary none` when a script needs structured output
directly on stdout inside an agent runtime.

## Envelope Shape

Large direct agent invocations usually print a YAML summary like:

```yaml
output_files:
  stdout: "$TMPDIR/twg/.../stdout.json"
  stdout_lines: 1050
  stdout_bytes: 39779
  compact: "$TMPDIR/twg/.../stdout.compact.json"
  compact_bytes: 1402
command: "jira workitem query"
resource_type: "jira:workitem"
agent_output:
  summary: "stats"
  view: "compact"
  fields: [data.issues.key, data.issues.summary, data.issues.status]
stdout_stats:
  top_level_keys: [apiVersion, command, data, meta]
  collections:
    "data.issues": 50
---END---
```

`collections` maps each array in the payload to its element count, primary
collection first, so "where are the rows and how many are there?" is answered
without opening the file. `"[]"` means the payload itself is the array. A payload
with more arrays than the envelope reports keeps the primary and contract-declared
ones and adds `collections_omitted: <n>` for the remainder.

Small payloads may include `stdout_inline` with the full JSON payload. Large
payloads include `stdout_stats`, and `stdout_shape` whenever the envelope
cannot otherwise describe the rows - it is omitted only when `collections`
locates them _and_ `agent_output.fields` says what they contain.

`agent_output.fields_unresolved` lists advertised fields whose container was
present but which the payload did not carry - a field the contract promised and
the response did not deliver. Paths from a response dialect that does not apply
are not reported, and an empty result reports nothing.

A failed command puts the diagnosis first, at every summary level:

```yaml
ok: false
error:
  code: "TWG_COMMAND_FAILED"
  kind: "twg_command_failed"
  message: "No goal found for key \"NONEXISTENT-1\"."
  repair: "Check the goal key with `twg goals query`."
  retry:
    recommended: false
    guidance: "do_not_retry_unchanged"
output_files:
  stdout: "$TMPDIR/twg/.../stdout.json"
---END---
```

Act on `error.repair` and `error.retry.guidance` directly. Bulk diagnostics
(`backendFailure`, `traceId`, `feedback`) stay in `output_files.stdout`.

## Reading Rule

The YAML summary is a pointer, not the answer.

- If `stdout_inline` is present, you may answer from it.
- If `output_files.compact` is present, inspect that compact JSON first. It is
  generated from the command's advertised output contract and is usually enough
  for routing, titles, owners, statuses, URLs, and dates.
- If `stdout_stats` or `stdout_shape` is present and `output_files.compact` is
  absent or insufficient, filter `output_files.stdout` with targeted `jq`.
- For answers that require item names, URLs, owners, statuses, blockers, dates, or
  evidence, read the JSON file even when the summary looks plausible.

**`stdout_shape` samples are statistical, not exhaustive.** The shape shows a
merged schema with a small number of example string values per field — it is not a
complete inventory. For `context` commands this matters most: external artifact links
(Figma, GitHub, Google Docs, and other third-party app URLs) appear toward the
**tail** of relationship arrays and are the entries most likely to be absent from
`stdout_shape` samples. If the goal is relationship or URL discovery, always read
`output_files.stdout` rather than treating shape samples as the full result. The
related workflow guidance lives in `twg-context-discovery/SKILL.md`.

## Output Budget Controls

Use these flags to keep agent stdout manageable:

```bash
twg <cmd> --output-summary stats
twg <cmd> --output-summary auto
twg <cmd> --output-summary none
twg <cmd> --agent-fields data.items.key,data.items.status
twg <cmd> --select data.items.key,data.items.status
```

- `--output-summary stats` - smallest stdout; best for broad discovery.
- `--output-summary auto` - inline small results, summarize large results.
- `--output-summary inline` - force inline selected data; in agent mode very
  large inline payloads are capped and fall back to file-backed summary output.
- `--output-summary none` - disable automatic summary envelopes and emit the
  selected structured format directly on stdout.
- `--agent-fields` - narrow the summary while preserving the full JSON file.
  Presets such as `@rows`, `@compact`, and `@evidence` are command-scoped when
  advertised by help; on commands without a preset contract they safely fall
  back to the normal summary envelope. Literal field paths remain supported for
  custom projections.
- `--select` - narrow the **payload itself**. Unlike `--agent-fields`, which only
  adds a compact sidecar next to the full JSON, `--select` applies before
  serialization, so `output_files.stdout`, `--output-file`, plain
  `--output json` stdout, and streaming `--output jsonl` records all carry only
  the selected paths. Accepts the same literal paths and `@preset` names. Prefer
  it over piping raw output through `jq`. A selection that matches nothing emits
  the full payload and a `runtime_advisories.selectUnmatched` entry rather than
  an empty envelope; on routes with no envelope slot for advisories the same
  warning goes to stderr. A selection that is part literal paths and part
  presets the command does not advertise projects the paths that resolved and
  names the dropped presets under `runtime_advisories.selectUnresolved` - a
  separate key from `selectUnmatched`, because the payload _was_ projected.
  A top-level array payload stays an array.
  Failed commands are never projected - the `ok: false` recovery envelope is
  returned whole, because `error.code`, `error.repair`, and `error.retry` are
  the actionable content and none of them sit under a selected data path.

Use `@rows` or `@compact` before writing custom JSON filters for broad scans.
Use `@evidence` after narrowing to the few artifacts that need fuller detail.

If `output_files.compact` is present, use it instead of probing the raw JSON.
If field paths are unknown, run `twg help describe "<exact command>"` and use
the advertised output view or jq snippet.

For structured JSON, inspect the top-level shape once and then write a targeted
projection. Do not retry multiple incompatible `.data.*`, `.result.*`, or
array-vs-object guesses. Combine related facts in one `jq` projection per output
file instead of running repeated `jq .` or one-field probes.

If a local `jq` command fails, stop probing nearby paths. Re-read the compact
file or the command's help-described view, then use at most one exact projection.
A collection reported as `0` means "no rows returned". A collection absent from
`stdout_stats.collections` means the payload holds no such array at all - not
that the output contract changed. The exception is `collections_omitted`: when
that key is present the list was capped, so `n` further arrays exist that the
envelope did not name, and absence proves nothing. Use `stdout_shape` or `jq`
to locate them.

Before opening another large output file, run a sufficiency check: do you already
have the names/keys, owners, statuses, dates, risks/blockers, and evidence URLs
needed for the requested answer? If yes, synthesize. Only inspect another raw
file when it will change a ranking, owner, risk, blocker, relationship, or next
action.

When comparing many compact files, avoid a sequence of one-file filters such as
`jq '{Alice:.}' file`. Use one combined projection with `jq -n`/slurp inputs, or
read the compact summaries directly and only filter the few raw files that will
change the answer.

## When To Pass `--output-file`

Default: do not pass it. Agent defaults already write a full JSON payload and report
the path in `output_files.stdout`.

Pass `--output-file` only when stable filenames make a recipe easier, for example
a parallel context batch:

```bash
twg jira workitem get PROJ-123 --output-file "$TMPDIR/PROJ-123.json"
twg context jira workitem PROJ-123 --output-file "$TMPDIR/ctx_PROJ-123.json"
```

Use `$TMPDIR`, not hard-coded `/tmp`, because agent sandboxes vary.

## Large Payload Strategy

| Payload size         | What to do                                                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Small / inline       | Read `stdout_inline` directly                                     |
| Compact file present | Read `output_files.compact` first                                 |
| Under about 50 KiB   | Open `output_files.stdout` directly                               |
| Large                | Use `jq` or another targeted filter against `output_files.stdout` |

Examples:

```bash
jq '.data.edges[].node | {key, title, status, url}' "$OUT"
jq '.data.items[] | {name, owner, updatedAt}' "$OUT"
```

Do not use `rg` to inspect TWG JSON. It treats structured data like text and
can re-expose hundreds of KiB of raw payload. Use `jq` with the paths from
`twg help describe "<exact command>"`.

Do not paste giant JSON into the final answer. Extract the facts and cite the
artifact URLs or keys that support them.
