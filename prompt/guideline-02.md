# Cursor Development Rules & AI Collaboration Guide



## 📜 Core Philosophy



1. **Simplicity:** Prioritize simple, clear, and maintainable solutions. Avoid unnecessary complexity or over-engineering.
2. **Iterate:** Prefer iterating on existing, working code rather than building entirely new solutions from scratch, unless fundamentally necessary or explicitly requested.
3. **Focus:** Concentrate efforts on the specific task assigned. Avoid unrelated changes or scope creep.
4. **Quality:** Strive for a clean, organized, well-tested, and secure codebase.
5. **Collaboration:** This document guides both human developers and the AI assistant for effective teamwork.



## 📚 Project Context & Understanding



1. **Documentation First:**

- **Always** check for and thoroughly review relevant project documentation _before_ starting any task. This includes:
- Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- `README.md` (Project overview, setup, patterns, technology stack)
- `docs/architecture.md` (System architecture, component relationships)
- `docs/technical.md` (Technical specifications, established patterns)
- `tasks/tasks.md` (Current development tasks, requirements)
- If documentation is missing, unclear, or conflicts with the request, **ask for clarification**.

2. **Architecture Adherence:**

- Understand and respect module boundaries, data flow, system interfaces, and component dependencies outlined in `docs/architecture.md`.
- Validate that changes comply with the established architecture. Warn and propose compliant solutions if a violation is detected.

3. **Pattern & Tech Stack Awareness:**

- Reference `README.md` and `docs/technical.md` to understand and utilize existing patterns and technologies.
- Exhaust options using existing implementations before proposing new patterns or libraries.



## ⚙️ Task Execution & Workflow



1. **Task Definition:**

- Clearly understand the task requirements, acceptance criteria, and any dependencies from `tasks/tasks.md` and the PRD.

2. **Systematic Change Protocol:** Before making significant changes:

- **Identify Impact:** Determine affected components, dependencies, and potential side effects.
- **Plan:** Outline the steps. Tackle one logical change or file at a time.
- **Verify Testing:** Confirm how the change will be tested. Add tests if necessary _before_ implementing (see TDD).

3. **Progress Tracking:**

- Keep `docs/status.md` updated with task progress (in-progress, completed, blocked), issues encountered, and completed items.
- Update `tasks/tasks.md` upon task completion or if requirements change during implementation.



## 🤖 AI Collaboration & Prompting



1. **Clarity is Key:** Provide clear, specific, and unambiguous instructions to the AI. Define the desired outcome, constraints, and context.
2. **Context Referencing:** If a task spans multiple interactions, explicitly remind the AI of relevant previous context, decisions, or code snippets.
3. **Suggest vs. Apply:** Clearly state whether the AI should _suggest_ a change for human review or _apply_ a change directly (use only when high confidence and task is well-defined). Use prefixes like "Suggestion:" or "Applying fix:".
4. **Question AI Output:** Human developers should critically review AI-generated code. Question assumptions, verify logic, and don't blindly trust confident-sounding but potentially incorrect suggestions (hallucinations).
5. **Focus the AI:** Guide the AI to work on specific, focused parts of the task. Avoid overly broad requests that might lead to architectural or logical errors.
6. **Leverage Strengths:** Use the AI for tasks it excels at (boilerplate generation, refactoring specific patterns, finding syntax errors, generating test cases) but maintain human oversight for complex logic, architecture, and security.
7. **Incremental Interaction:** Break down complex tasks into smaller steps for the AI. Review and confirm each step before proceeding.
8. **Standard Check-in (for AI on large tasks):** Before providing significant code suggestions:

- "Confirming understanding: I've reviewed [specific document/previous context]. The goal is [task goal], adhering to [key pattern/constraint]. Proceeding with [planned step]." (This replaces the more robotic "STOP AND VERIFY").



## ✨ Code Quality & Style



1. **TypeScript Guidelines:** Use strict typing (avoid `any`). Document complex logic or public APIs with JSDoc.
2. **Readability & Maintainability:** Write clean, well-organized code.
3. **Small Files & Components:**

- Keep files under **300 lines**. Refactor proactively.
- Break down large React components into smaller, single-responsibility components.

4. **Avoid Duplication (DRY):** Actively look for and reuse existing functionality. Refactor to eliminate duplication.
5. **No Bazel:** Bazel is not permitted. Use project-specified build tools.
6. **Linting/Formatting:** Ensure all code conforms to project's ESLint/Prettier rules.
7. **Pattern Consistency:** Adhere to established project patterns. Don't introduce new ones without discussion/explicit instruction. If replacing an old pattern, ensure the old implementation is fully removed.
8. **File Naming:** Use clear, descriptive names. Avoid "temp", "refactored", "improved", etc., in permanent file names.
9. **No One-Time Scripts:** Do not commit one-time utility scripts into the main codebase.



## ♻️ Refactoring



1. **Purposeful Refactoring:** Refactor to improve clarity, reduce duplication, simplify complexity, or adhere to architectural goals.
2. **Holistic Check:** When refactoring, look for duplicate code, similar components/files, and opportunities for consolidation across the affected area.
3. **Edit, Don't Copy:** Modify existing files directly. Do not duplicate files and rename them (e.g., `component-v2.tsx`).
4. **Verify Integrations:** After refactoring, ensure all callers, dependencies, and integration points function correctly. Run relevant tests.



## ✅ Testing & Validation



1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**

- **New Features:** Outline tests, write failing tests, implement code, refactor.
- **Bug Fixes:** Write a test reproducing the bug _before_ fixing it.

2. **Comprehensive Tests:** Write thorough unit, integration, and/or end-to-end tests covering critical paths, edge cases, and major functionality.
3. **Tests Must Pass:** All tests **must** pass before committing or considering a task complete. Notify the human developer immediately if tests fail and cannot be easily fixed.
4. **No Mock Data (Except Tests):** Use mock data _only_ within test environments. Development and production should use real or realistic data sources.
5. **Manual Verification:** Supplement automated tests with manual checks where appropriate, especially for UI changes.



## 🐛 Debugging & Troubleshooting



1. **Fix the Root Cause:** Prioritize fixing the underlying issue causing an error, rather than just masking or handling it, unless a temporary workaround is explicitly agreed upon.
2. **Console/Log Analysis:** Always check browser and server console output for errors, warnings, or relevant logs after making changes or when debugging. Report findings.
3. **Targeted Logging:** For persistent or complex issues, add specific `console.log` statements (or use a project logger) to trace execution and variable states. _Remember to check the output._
4. **Check the `fixes/` Directory:** Before deep-diving into a complex or recurring bug, check `fixes/` for documented solutions to similar past issues.
5. **Document Complex Fixes:** If a bug requires significant effort (multiple iterations, complex logic) to fix, create a concise `.md` file in the `fixes/` directory detailing the problem, investigation steps, and the solution. Name it descriptively (e.g., `fixes/resolve-race-condition-in-user-update.md`).
6. **Research:** Use available tools (Firecrawl, documentation search, etc.) to research solutions or best practices when stuck or unsure.



## 🔒 Security



1. **Server-Side Authority:** Keep sensitive logic, validation, and data manipulation strictly on the server-side. Use secure API endpoints.
2. **Input Sanitization/Validation:** Always sanitize and validate user input on the server-side.
3. **Dependency Awareness:** Be mindful of the security implications of adding or updating dependencies.
4. **Credentials:** Never hardcode secrets or credentials in the codebase. Use environment variables or a secure secrets management solution.



## 🌳 Version Control & Environment



1. **Git Hygiene:**

- Commit frequently with clear, atomic messages.
- Keep the working directory clean; ensure no unrelated or temporary files are staged or committed.
- Use `.gitignore` effectively.

2. **Branching Strategy:** Follow the project's established branching strategy. Do not create new branches unless requested or necessary for the workflow (e.g., feature branches).
3. **.env Files:** **Never** commit `.env` files. Use `.env.example` for templates. Do not overwrite local `.env` files without confirmation.
4. **Environment Awareness:** Code should function correctly across different environments (dev, test, prod). Use environment variables for configuration.
5. **Server Management:** Kill related running servers before starting new ones. Restart servers after relevant configuration or backend changes.



## 📄 Documentation Maintenance



1. **Update Docs:** If code changes impact architecture, technical decisions, established patterns, or task status, update the relevant documentation (`README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/technical.md`, `tasks/tasks.md`, `docs/status.md`).
2. **Keep Rules Updated:** This `.cursorrules` file should be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect learned best practices and project evolution.
