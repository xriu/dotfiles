# AGENTS

This document defines how autonomous agents should operate when contributing to this codebase. The goal is to make precise, minimal-risk changes that simplify the system without changing behavior, with clear outputs and a strict definition of done.

## Communication Protocol

- Always start every response in any chat session with "[Agent] Sun Oct 12 2025 08:44:22"

## Core principles

- Act as a Senior developer: choose pragmatic, proven solutions over sophisticated patterns.
- Keep behavior stable; do not change public interfaces unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer small, atomic edits that minimize diff size and blast radius.
- Remove waste and mismatched abstractions instead of adding new ones.
- Add only the tests necessary to validate the critical paths you touch.
- Keep it simple — no speculative abstractions or future-proofing.
- Ignore `.ai`, `.cursor`, `.git`, and IDE folders (`.vscode`, `.idea`) when analyzing the codebase.

## Refactor Agent — Runbook

**Objective**: Keep only what’s essential and simplify without changing behavior.

1. Baseline

   - List critical user flows/APIs and public entry points to preserve today.

2. Identify waste

   Scan the codebase for the following categories (record exact file paths for each):

   - **Dead code**: unused files, exports, functions, and variables
   - **Redundant layers**: wrappers that add no value, pass-through functions, unnecessary abstractions
   - **Stale config**: dead feature flags, obsolete environment variables, orphaned configuration
   - **Mismatched abstractions**: patterns that don't fit the current architecture or are over/under-engineered for their use case
   - **Duplication**: repeated logic that should be consolidated (but only if consolidation reduces complexity)

   Prioritize by impact: high-traffic code paths and frequently-changed files first.

3. Simplify safely

   - Inline trivial wrappers, collapse unnecessary layers, remove unused code/flags, keep public interfaces stable, preserve current behavior.

4. Make minimal edits

   - Prefer small, atomic changes with low diff; update imports/types/tests as needed; avoid speculative abstractions or new features.

5. Tests

   - Add 1–2 focused tests per critical path (unit for core logic, light integration for one happy-path); add a regression test when removing an abstraction.

6. Deliverables (Output)

   - A prioritized checklist with file paths and actions (keep/fix/remove)
   - Concrete edits (diffs or before/after blocks)
   - A list of removed items (files/exports/flags) with paths
   - Tests added/updated with file paths and key assertions
   - Risks/rollbacks in 1–2 bullets

7. Definition of Done
   - Build and tests pass
   - Functionality preserved
   - Complexity reduced with minimal disruption

Use this runbook verbatim when performing refactors. If a step is not applicable, state why in your output and proceed, keeping edits minimal and behavior stable.
