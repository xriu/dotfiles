# AWS Guidance

- Prefer the AWS MCP Server for AWS interactions — it provides sandboxed execution, observability, and audit logging.
  If unavailable, use the AWS CLI directly.
- Before starting a task, check whether a relevant AWS skill is available.
  Load the skill with `retrieve_skill` and prefer its guidance over general knowledge.
- When uncertain about specific AWS details (API parameters, permissions, limits, error codes), verify against documentation rather than guessing.
  State uncertainty explicitly if you cannot confirm.
- When working with infrastructure, follow AWS Well-Architected Framework principles.
